While the hotel itself is aesthetically pleasing and situated in a desirable part of the city, the service and lack of basic comfort provided by the staff and management overshadowed any of the property\u2019s superficial charm.\n\nTo start with the most egregious issue: the hotel refused to turn on the air conditioning throughout our stay. While Milan\u2019s temperatures were relatively cool prior to our arrival, the weather quickly shifted, and on our first day in the city, temperatures reached nearly 80\u00b0F (26\u00b0C). The rooms offered no air circulation, even with windows fully opened, which made it nearly impossible to sleep. Despite raising this concern multiple times with the staff, absolutely nothing was done to address the situation. The front desk and management gave us empty reassurances and long-winded explanations designed to talk around the problem instead of solving it.\n\nWe later found out that the hotel has a policy of not activating air conditioning unless the external temperature consistently exceeds 26\u00b0C. This is not just inconvenient\u2014it\u2019s misleading, especially considering their listing on Booking.com makes no mention of this policy. This is a serious integrity issue, and had we known this in advance, we would have chosen a different property entirely. A luxury hotel that charges premium rates should not fail to provide basic amenities like climate control, especially during warmer months.\n\nIn addition to the air conditioning issue, we encountered several other problems that were handled with the same level of indifference. Despite informing the hotel in advance that this trip was part of our honeymoon, we were assigned one of the smallest rooms in the hotel\u2014complete with two twin beds pushed together. This is not what we reserved, nor what we paid a premium for. Our booking clearly indicated a larger, more comfortable room, and at no point during our stay did anyone attempt to rectify this. The hotel staff simply dismissed our concerns and moved on as if we were just another inconvenience to deal with.\n\nThroughout our stay, the staff demonstrated a disturbing lack of professionalism, hospitality, and concern. It became painfully clear that the hotel\u2019s management is focused solely on maximizing profits\u2014likely due to the influx of tourists during Milan\u2019s Fashion Week and seasonal events\u2014rather than on guest satisfaction. Every interaction with the staff felt transactional, cold, and dismissive. They seemed far more interested in justifying problems than in solving them.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, because the hotel itself has potential. But a beautiful building is meaningless without a commitment to hospitality and customer care. Based on our experience, I strongly advise travelers to look elsewhere\u2014especially if you are planning a visit between April 1st and October 31st, as the hotel may refuse to provide air conditioning regardless of how warm it gets inside your room.\n\nFinal verdict: we will not be returning, and we cannot in good conscience recommend Tocq Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable or stress-free stay in Milan.", "time": 1744338034, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Mattis Berg", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101561962847958778612/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI7Psc911rP-Ttny-oWVOC2_kUU5c9CEyJhogMELXUcw-1yyYs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Great location the rooms were clean but a little scuffed.
