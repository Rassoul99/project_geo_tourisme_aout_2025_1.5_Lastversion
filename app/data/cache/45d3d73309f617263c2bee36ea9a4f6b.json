The quality of this renovation appears to be on the low end. Observations of h the painting of the elevator doors being peeled off by guests as the doors stick together when closed. The elevator did have a failure while we were in it so we ended up walking up the 5 floors to our room. The first morning at breakfast was a great disappointment with the room full of people waiting for the food to be replenished. When it was there was only 1 baguette brought out at a time and that disappeared immediately. The orange juice machine jammed so no juice. Day 2 and it was a bit better but there was no effort to get food out when platters were empty as trays of dishes were replaced one after another instead of interspersing them with platters of food. There were not enough employees in the morning to handle the front desk and the breakfast room when in the afternoon there were 3 at the front desk. The room was on the front of the building with a window that opened and it had an electric shutter (volet) but the noise from the street in front of the train station was very loud with the type of people you expect to find stopping traffic to do business in the evening. The AC unit did not add cool air but just  the fan when turned down to cool as it may not have been on for the season. One lamp was already burned out in a newly renovated room The Italian shower leaked under the glass and made a mess on the floor (housekeeping did provide 2 bath mats). The door to the WC would not latch closed. As noted in other reviews, the bed is not firm and has a soft mattress topper. This is not luxury bedding in any sense of the word. The room was clean with plenty of hot water. The lobby staff were not very welcoming and were even a bit rude when we could not figure out the code for the wifi as they told us it was written on the back of our room key wrapper but written so badly that we could not figure out the number. That's why we had to ask in the first place. What we thought was a 3 was actually a poorly scribbled 9 and there was no information in the room about the wifi. Even after the renovations were finished I would search for a better value for my money.", "time": 1554477170, "translated": false}], "types": ["establishment", "lodging", "point_of_interest"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=7022724730954589085", "user_ratings_total": 556, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "53 Av. de l'Union Sovi\u00e9tique, Clermont-Ferrand", "website": "https://all.accor.com/lien_externe.svlt?goto=fiche_hotel&code_hotel=B2W8&merchantid=seo-maps-FR-B2W8&sourceid=aw-cen&utm_medium=seo%20maps&utm_source=google%20Maps&utm_campaign=seo%20maps", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": false}
