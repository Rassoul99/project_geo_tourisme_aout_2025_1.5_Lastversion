I was in room 403 and I loved it. It was small but with 3 wonderful windows that opened to a quiet beautiful street. The voile curtains were so cute.

Beds were comfortable and sheets and towels were nice.\nThere was an employee named Charles who went out of his way to make sure my stay was perfect. He made me feel very welcome.\nI\u2019m a James Joyce fan so I enjoyed the excerpts from his book Ulysses that were placed on our beds at night.\nBreakfast was really good. The pistachio souffl\u00e9e on the dinner menu is a must have. ( I had it twice!)\nThe spa is really just a massage room- nothing fancy. But it was warm and comfortable.\nI thought the bar was uncomfortable and not welcoming. The light is too bright and something about the layout of the furniture is not inviting or comfortable. Also people are walking through it, and they trip over your feet when they are going by. I had to walk through the bar area to get to my room and it was always awkward.  I think the lobby area would make a better bar area and the cute library could serve as a lobby.\nThis hotel is not as luxurious as the Penisula, Shangra La, and Lutetia - but it was less pretentious and I did not feel underdressed walking through the bar in my clothes from my painting class. Everyone was so friendly that I felt right at home. And the neighborhood is my favorite in Paris.
