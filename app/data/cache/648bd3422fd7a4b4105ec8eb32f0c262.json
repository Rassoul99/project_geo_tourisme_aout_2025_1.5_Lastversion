For your kids and your health DONT!!!\nWhat I thought I was getting and what I got were 2 completely different things.\nI\u2019ll start with the positives because there are some. location . That\u2019s great. Security. Also great.\nNow the negatives. Check in was 3 pm. (Ok no big deal) got here at almost 4 and when I walk in the door with 4 tired kids and my tired elderly mom I\u2019m told we can\u2019t come in yet because she hasn\u2019t finished cleaning. Uhh ok.\nCome back after 10pm to actually see the room and WTF have I gotten us into. The charming apartment I got is not that.\n1- the smell!! It smells stale and wet, Nauseatingly so.\n2-  the windows in the kitchen/ studio don\u2019t open.\n3- the bathroom (not clean there\u2019s food in the sink, the floor is wet, and there\u2019s mold\u2026 everywhere)      4- The kitchen bed is made but there is stuff on the sheets and under the pillows it\u2019s clear the sheet or mattress * or both are stained.\n5- the bunk bed room is stuffy, moldy and mildewy\n6- the main rooms. This window opens . Not well tho because the bed block it and there is no screen. The outlets are lacking and the only one I could find is broken.\nNow on to the all over bad parts:\nThe filth- look I have 4 young kids and I work full time so I know what a unkept house looks like. This \u201ccleaned\u201d unit is filthy. The walls are covered in dirt, stains, mold, dust and food bits. The floor is equally as dirty.\nBut the absolute WORST part. The MOLD it is everywhere!!!! I live in the Midwest, I know mold. This is growing. The shower is moldy, the sink is moldy , the bathroom walls are moldy. The windows, the bunk room , the *master * is by far the worst though. It is so bad that I tried at 10:30 pm to get a refund so we could stay somewhere else . Maybe Paris doesn\u2019t have health codes for rentals because this is CRAZY to me. 5 of us are currently camped out in the living room bed while I look for another place for us to stay because this is awful.\nI wish Expedia cared about the listings they have because this should NOT be on there.\nI have tried to contact the lister stop see about a refund and was told they couldn\u2019t come look at the problem and I was still paying the cleaning fee. (Uhhh look at it . If I could walk away and get a refund I would) don\u2019t make my mistake\n\n**Edited 1.8.25 **\nAfter the \"owner\" suggested I reach out to expedia ( after I had and been denied.) I did again.
