We were provided a room on the 7th floor. We had to go up 7 flights of stairs for the remainder of the trip when we departed on 9/19. The part that was most disappointing was that the management/staff made no effort to either offer us a room on a lower floor, (which did appear they had available), assist us with our luggage on the AM of checkout, offer some IHG points (I am a member in long standing), etc. On one occasion, one of the staff members apology seemed very dismissive. We had additional family that had rooms on the 4th and and 5th floors and they had the same comments that I am providing. So what would have been a perfect trip to Paris was smudged by something that could have been handled by just being a little polite.
