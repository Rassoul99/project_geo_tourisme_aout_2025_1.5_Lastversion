The rooms were clean and comfortable, and housekeeping kept everything neat the whole time.

I also liked the view of the streets from my room, which gave it a nice Paris feel without being noisy.\n\nThe staff were friendly and accommodating, and they spoke English well enough that communication was never a problem. Breakfast was a buffet for 14 euros, and it was more than enough to make a full meal, which made mornings easy and saved some money compared to eating out every day. Between the location, the service, and the overall atmosphere, it felt like a good balance of comfort and value for a longer stay.\n\nThe only downsides were the WiFi and the pillows. The internet was a bit slow at times, and in the upper rooms the connection didn\u2019t always hold up well, especially in the evenings. Also, a couple of the pillows had a faint smell that wasn\u2019t very pleasant, even though the rest of the room was spotless. Those things aside, I thought it was a solid place to stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, convenient base in central Paris.", "time": 1756030137, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Frank Wright", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107735963818664155802/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK607yqMtPhht8Bws_BMGtn6AVf7wtUJv4eiJXybA0GG7tRnw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "Overall excellent hotel in great location near Od\u00e9on.
