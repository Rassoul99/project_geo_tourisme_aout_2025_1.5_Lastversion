It is located in one of the backstreets but with the Metro and tram stops nearby. The apartments we stayed were well equipped with a kitchenette and one of them even with the washing machine. The rooms were air-conditioned and generally clean and good. However, the standard of housekeeping was disappointing during our two stays. During our first three-nights-day, the housekeeping was not done until we hurried them at 5 pm in the afternoon. Moreover, irritating issues like washing gel in the bathroom had long been used up without having replaced, not to say the washing powder. So, we have to prepare these basic utensils for our own use. Worst came during our second stay. We arrived at the hotel slightly before 2 pm, and was told that the room would not be not ready until 3 pm. So we went out for a walk during the very hot weather, and returned to the hotel, soaking, at 3pm, only to know that the rooms were still not ready because of the housekeeping. The seating area at the reception was very small, and there were full of people waiting for their rooms to be ready. We stood for a while in the lobby, having nowhere to sit, and wondered what had happened to the household management of the hotel. The staff at the reception was nice enough to open the Hotel restaurant for us to have a seat. (The restaurant was only opened during breakfast and after 5 pm). He was nice enough to listen to our complaint and offered us a bottle of water while we waited for our apartment to be cleaned. We managed to check in after 3:30 pm. But while we walked past the lobby, it was still full of people waiting for their rooms to be cleaned.\n\nTo conclude, the hotel was nice for a one night stay, especially when you know you will check in late. Otherwise, I guess there are a lot of other hotels in the town that have rooms available on time.\n\nParking is not on site. It is valet parking and cost \u20ac32 per 24 hours.

The Agostino train station is just a short walk away, making it easy to get around the city. The neighborhood itself is pretty nice, with some good cafes and minimarkets right nearby.\n\nOverall, the hotel felt a bit below the typical Mercure standard I\u2019m used to, but the price was definitely fair, especially compared to other hotels in Milan. The room was perfectly adequate; it wasn't super small and had everything we needed. It was a comfortable base for our trip and felt like a good value for the cost.\n\nThe service, though, really stood out. Daniela at the front desk was fantastic. Her hospitality was exceptional. We arrived well before our scheduled check-in time, and she was incredibly helpful, letting us use a meeting room for several hours until our room was ready.
