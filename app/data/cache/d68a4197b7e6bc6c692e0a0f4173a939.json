So I went to the front desk again and asked for a vacant room.  I was given a vacant room and finally fell asleep at 3:00am.  However, the following morning at 10:30am the manager pounded on my door and demanded that I vacate the room immediately.  She shouted at me and didn't bother to identify herself.  I was totally bewildered and dazed.   I told her I would be out in 30 minutes.  When I came out to the front desk between 11:00 and 11:30 she gave me coffee and another room. I was exhausted. Later, around 1:00pm, the same manager with her horrific thick round glasses which made her appearance all the more menacing proceeded to double charge me for the additional room.  I tried to explained to her what happened but she yelled at the top of her lungs and said she didn't want to hear what I had to say and that she knew what I was going to say.  She screamed and said if I didn't pay for the room which by the way was sitting vacant at 2:00am when I arrived and available to rent the following day by noon, that she would kick our entire tour party out of the hotel.  So I paid the $102 Euros for the room - which she said was 50% off.  I now see it now listed for $55 on the Internet.  So I got screwed there.  She is a total disaster of a human. I could see the entire staff of the hotel lives in fear of her and her explosive nature.  I truly feel sorry for her.  I believe somewhere inside her is a kind person however she clearly feels that in order to make her way in the world she must be in her masculine and be a full blown bully.  Readers of this review would be advised to avoid this hotel for at least 12 months from posting and/or until the entire staff gets training and recovers from her nastiness. Also my room didn't have a waste basket and when I asked for one, it was \"impossible\".  There is a top down problem with this hotel.   Lastly, I didn't like the location of the hotel as it is not in the best area and unsafe at night.  You definitely can't walk around there at night.", "time": 1696895884, "translated": false}], "types": ["establishment", "lodging", "point_of_interest"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=2874040538637193946", "user_ratings_total": 1623, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "77 Bd de l'Embouchure, Toulouse", "website": "https://www.hotel-bb.com/fr/hotel/toulouse-centre?utm_source=googlemaps&utm_medium=fichehotel&utm_campaign=yext", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}
