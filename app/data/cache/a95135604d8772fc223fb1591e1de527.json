check-in, the receptionist was distracted and unprofessional, which left us confused. She was half checking us in and half chatting with her peers; it took forever with the process. She even told us breakfast was included, only for us to be told the next morning by an even more rude receptionist man that it wasn\u2019t. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have minded paying for breakfast, but the way the situation was handled felt dismissive and unpleasant.\n\nThe hotel itself also leaves much to be desired. The location is inconvenient \u2014 at least a 10-minute walk to the nearest train stations and far from the city center. On top of that, half the property seems to be under construction, which takes away from any sense of comfort.\n\nThe only positive I can mention is that the rooms are fairly spacious for a city hotel. Beyond that, this property is not up to Marriott standards. I won\u2019t be coming back, and I\u2019d recommend spending your holiday money elsewhere.\n\nTL;DR:\n\u2022\tInconvenient location\n\u2022\tRude, unprofessional service\n\u2022\tSpacious rooms (the only plus)", "time": 1759175081, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Swathi", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103942871929694434612/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKtHQ3enbTDxBXy3N6YXt8-nIBa5wZHnZw2rRszrZ4kmDHvcu0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "The location is fantastic in terms of amenities.

Breakfast is good \u2014 they offer three types (express, continental, and American), priced between \u20ac16 and \u20ac22. The only downside is that the rooms are a little cramped.\n\nThe only frustrating part was the lack of food-heating options.

The renovation efforts are clearly aimed at elevating the overall guest experience.\n\nIn terms of location, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. The hotel is about a kilometer from the nearest metro station, so be prepared to walk a little. It is also not in the immediate vicinity of Milan\u2019s major attractions, which might be a drawback for first-time visitors hoping to sightsee with ease. On the bright side, the hotel is right in front of a large supermarket and is surrounded by several restaurant options, which adds convenience for everyday needs.\n\nOverall, I genuinely enjoyed my stay.
