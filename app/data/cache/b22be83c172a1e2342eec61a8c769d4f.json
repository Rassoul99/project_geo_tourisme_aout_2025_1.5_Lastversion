Prior to my stay, I carefully reviewed the hotel\u2019s history and guest experiences, and even watched an interview with the owner, whose family also manages another renowned property in Paris. The building is undeniably a historical monument located in the very heart of the city, and its architectural beauty and prime location are truly remarkable.\n\nThe reception staff demonstrated a high level of professionalism, and the overall service at the front desk met five-star expectations. However, I feel it is important to share certain aspects of my stay that did not align with the standard one would anticipate from a hotel of this category.\n\nUnfortunately, the hotel is in urgent need of renovation. The carpets throughout the property, including in the guest rooms, are heavily worn and emit a strong musty and stale odor, which significantly affected my comfort. In my room, I found it unpleasant to walk on the carpet, and the general atmosphere felt unclean and outdated.\n\nHousekeeping services were insufficient. While towels were replaced and the bed was made, the room was not thoroughly cleaned. Dust was present on multiple surfaces, and the bathtub showed visible signs of mold. Additionally, the room lacked a proper coffee machine, which is a basic amenity expected in a five-star accommodation.\n\nWhile I fully appreciate the historical value of the building, there is a clear distinction between preserving heritage and neglecting necessary maintenance. The current condition of the interiors does not reflect the quality and comfort associated with luxury hospitality.\n\nI hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements. With thoughtful renovation and attention to detail, the H\u00f4tel Regina Louvre has the potential to truly live up to its five-star status.", "time": 1750610908, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Rocky Smith", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101125368944546869312/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLnidZrtsiTgSYVisL_I9wGjLA39reyzNnbDmIh4MBZ9Tvndg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "We had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Regina in Paris a few days ago.
