Bathroom is small but there's still plenty of space. My room had AC but the heating didn't work. So they had two extra heaters which was good for when you're changing clothes or showering but it's not enough to heat the room. 1 blanket was okay but I think when it's freezing you might need an extra one.

However my girlfriend and I decided to book it as we only really needed a bed for the nights we were staying, as we were going to be exploring the rest of the time. I have to say I am so glad we did!\nIt is ideally looked about 5-10 minutes walk from the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, and a 3 minute walk from a Metro station. We arrived exactly at the earliest Check-In time, where we were pleasantly greeted by one of the receptionists. As we were staying for 5 nights she recommended to return in an hour or so after some more of the rooms had been cleaned so we could have one of the rooms which looked onto the courtyard at the back as those are slightly bigger. We happily agreed, took a walk to the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur (stunning views across the city). Upon returning we were given room 505, which apparently was one of the biggest at the hotel. It was ideal for us, not a view out over the city but we weren't planning on just staying in the hotel to look at the city! The lift in the hotel is apparently the smallest in Paris, which I would agree with as it only holds 3 people (minus luggage), if you have big suitcases it's likely you'll have to go up individually. The entrance area and eating/bar area or quite modern and very well kept. The rest of the hotel is a little dated and the air conditioning units are also a little dated but worked well in the 32 degree weather while we were there. We didn't have the breakfast included in our room but told we could add this on if we wanted (we didn't as we wanted to try the local bakeries). We needed to print out a couple of attraction tickets and the hotel was able to help us with that (30 cents per page). Our room was nice, clean and well kept. The water drained quite slowly in the bathroom so we had to turn off the water every so often when showering so it didn't overflow out of the shower tray but other than that everything was fine. When visiting do beware that the metro does close after 1:40am weekdays and 12:40 on Saturday & Sundays, and with the hotel being about 3 miles from the Eiffel Tower is quite a trek to walk after a long day.  Overall a very pleasant stay and we would both recommend this to anyone who wants to explore the city.", "time": 1498851688, "translated": false}], "types": ["establishment", "lodging", "point_of_interest"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=13726571930386351859", "user_ratings_total": 508, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "100 Blvd Marguerite de Rochechouart, Paris", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}
