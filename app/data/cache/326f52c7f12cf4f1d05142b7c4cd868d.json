My grandmother, who still had many good years ahead of her, recently paid the price, as did my dad, who had to tirelessly compensate for this and be by her side every day, noon and evening. A resident who, due to a lack of care adapted to her condition, wandered around and then attacked other residents, including my grandmother. For your information, on the day of the attack in this case, April 7, staff deliberately lied, stating that she had fallen alone in her room and deleted the video recordings of the common room (the scene of the attack), which were useful in revealing the truth. The truth was finally uncovered thanks to our \"investigation\" which highlighted contradictions and it turned out that a resident had attacked my grandmother in the middle of the night while she was in her room, had come and knocked on her door to make her leave, had made her fall to the floor and had kicked her in the common room. If someone had been present she could have been protected. We later discovered that unfortunately my grandmother was not the first victim, this same person had already violently attacked another resident on February 28. The lack of decisions to relieve this person so that she was no longer a danger to herself and others was fatal for my grandmother and our family. She is now between life and death in the hospital, she who was not taking any medical treatment and was in good health. We are aware that this kind of thing can happen in a secure living unit once, but the repetition of the events with the same accusations and inaction raises questions; indeed, the latter was still wandering around the unit without taking any special precautions, endangering other residents and leaving my grandmother terrified. It was only after multiple requests and anger that measures were taken for this visibly suffering person, undoubtedly saving other residents from her uncontrolled violence.\n\nThe lies and the lack of an appropriate response only accentuate our deep sadness and anger and have broken any relationship of trust with this facility.\n\nFrance Delmas", "time": 1718977931, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Jean-francois PETIT", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118074498576723065100/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "fr", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIrw36-F4XBa2ETAl0n598DUGCrVwcsBF7Xh-kCoA9iAMYDyA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "Friendly staff, a top-notch director.
