and you pay the balance on checkout.\n\nThe rooms are quite small but I was fine with that - I had a top floor room overlooking the internal courtyard so I could leave my windows wide open and have no noise, but it was a very quiet street so my guess is that all rooms are quiet.\n\nThey offer a breakfast in the basement for about 10 euros but I found a nice similarly priced pavement cafe called la fronde at the end of the street which did an excellent breakfast for the same price so went there as i like eating outside in august if possible.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and check in and check out was very quick.  There is a small lift but I actually quite liked using the stairs.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable and the shower was good as well.  I like the way there was a metro a few yards from the hotel and it was only 5 minutes walk from the main chatalet station which has the RER B line that connects to both the airport and the eurostar", "time": 1757280309, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Sunzone Traveler", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108753991379450354258/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXPiQobQcfzS8ihvL19wOVvTpzDk-Olcql0bE7K44TVAk0dfBJ_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Small Hotel in a wonderful location.

Not worth the money.\nSo the rooms are quite small and bathroom is even smaller, you can\u2019t move your hands in shower.

In all the countries I travelled in Europe, such behaviour I only see here. Also while I checked in my room, it was hot as flame and AC was not working- on asking reception lady said do this do that and I kept struggling- and after few minutes she called that it was switched off from reception and now she has switched it on and mind it they will switch it off any time they want and you will keep struggling!\n\nResponse to their reply: Window was open when you came?? Did you even read what I mentioned?? Ask your reception lady what happened the day I arrived, dont just respond for the sake of responding.\nMoreover your lack of accepting that service was not upto the mark, is the reason hotels like yours never improves! What hospitality are you talking about???? Not even offering water to guests who come to your hotel durimg checkin- is a part of your hospitality or not even greeting them when they arruve is a part??? Not having even a handwash ir soap at wash basin to wash hands??? A single soap bottle in shower area was there- guest should use that bottle at basin and then bathing???
