Has a small basic mini bar but no coffee facilities which really should be a basic offer in this type of room.\nThe room was a bit tired and maybe could do with some updating but for the price it is a good value option.\nService at the front desk was pleasant, friendly and efficient.\nI personally liked the interior d\u00e9cor of the hotel.\nBreakfast buffet selection was basic but ok.  There is a limited selection compared to other hotels I've stayed at but the quality and freshness was fine and I didn't go without.  Only criticism of the breakfast is that the cutlery and crockery wasn't clean enough, I had to sort through the bowls and spoons to find what I felt was clean.\nLocation is very good and well connected with lots of places to eat, drink and shop close by.

End result? They gave us a standing fan so we used it as an exhaust fan to blow the mold, humidity and a bit of heat out the window.\n\nIf your hotel guests are complaining about heat and breathing issues due to mold during the summer and you know the AC is broken, how dare you charge 100euro per night for basic needs?\n\nThe location is kinda sketchy and is very loud at night and at early mornings. With the AC not working/with mold and windows opened for the fan, it was a bad stay.
