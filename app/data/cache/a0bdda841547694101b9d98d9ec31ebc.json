toilet was removed and water was leaking on the bathroom floor)... The restaurant next door made the room smell terrible and the room soundproofing was also poor. Breakfast was miserable - a bakery offers better alternatives at half the price. However, what was most appalling was the attitude of one receptionist which negatively affected our last day.\n\nOur family of 3 had a late flight and so we checked out early, left our bags at reception and spent the day in the city. When we went back to the hotel at 7PM to charge our phones and book an airport taxi, the receptionist acted like we were loitering although we had told her that we would soon be getting a taxi (which arrived at 7:30PM). Our understanding is that hotel lobbies are there to be used to wait for taxis and converse with one another, but she was clearly not of the same opinion.\n\nDespite being out of her way and eyesight, she behaved as though we were bothering her by being there. There was nobody else in the reception area and so we were not disturbing anyone, yet she felt the need to come up to us to ask us what time we had checked out, following which she looked at her watch and made a tutting sound.\n\nShe turned down our request to use a bathroom as somehow this hotel only has bathrooms in its rooms and none in the reception area. When we asked if we can use the hotel restaurant's bathroom, she discouraged us from doing so by telling us that we had to pay for drinks (as if we had not just checked out and paid for our hotel stay!) The best part of this interaction was that she held a mocking smile throughout much of the conversation, showing her lack of empathy which is odd given that she holds a receptionist role in the hospitality industry. As a person who has worked in various hotels and roles (including hers!), this encounter was baffling to me.\n\nTo make matters worse, we left a review sharing our experience and the hotel responded by lying about the entire incident. We've never experienced this kind of behaviour towards guests, but it truly shows what kind of customer service they offer and how much they value their guests.", "time": 1727724244, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Luisa", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114412411951795649429/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJtahri9aslDGi-vSvUeIrLAwg2_TuTuV4SeHn-2wLaD_z-Lg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "- central location\n- expect noise during the night since the hotel is located at a busy street\n- room was quite small and walls are not insulated against noise\n- No safe in the room to store valuables coupled with VERY relaxed security made me feel unsafe\n- there is a strange concept of leaving the room keys (they don\u2019t operate with cards) at the reception when you leave the hotel for \u201csecurity reasons\u201d.
