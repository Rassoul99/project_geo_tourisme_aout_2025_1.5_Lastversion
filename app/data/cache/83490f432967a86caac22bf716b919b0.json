Shortly thereafter, we received a voicemail from the hotel receptionist accusing us of having left without paying our bill. Upon returning to the hotel, we sought clarification, only to have the accusation repeated to our faces.\n\nWe reminded the receptionist that check-out was not for another two and a half hours and explained that we had simply gone out for breakfast. Her response was: \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you were going for breakfast. How was I supposed to know?\u201d When we asked whether she had made similar accusations against other guests that morning, she claimed that all other guests inform her of their whereabouts when leaving the premises\u2014a highly implausible and, we believe, dishonest statement.\n\nWhen we requested her name, she refused to provide it. Only after repeated inquiries did she tell us her name was \u201cGrace,\u201d though we have strong reason to believe this may not be accurate. She also failed to respond when we asked whether she had seen us leave with luggage (we had not) or whether she had checked the room (she had not). Nor did she explain why she made no mention of this supposed concern when we dropped our key at the front desk, as required by the hotel.\n\nThe following day, we sent a detailed email to the hotel director, Madame Estelle Baumann, explaining the situation. We received no reply. A week later, we sent a polite follow-up, stating that we were holding off on publishing a public review in case she wished to respond. To date, we have received no acknowledgment. Given this continued silence, we feel a responsibility to inform other travelers.\n\nIn terms of the general quality of the hotel, we can only echo other critical reviews. This establishment does not meet the standards of a four-star hotel. The rooms are small, stuffy, and lacking many of the amenities one would reasonably expect. For example, there was no functioning air conditioning\u2014despite warm temperatures during our stay in late April in southern France. The reception informed us that AC would not be available until summer, a claim contradicted by other guest reviews. It appears the hotel simply removes the remote controls until they see fit to return them.\n\nOverall, this was one of the worst hotel experiences we\u2019ve had in over 200 stays across Europe. Never before have we been falsely accused of attempting to leave without paying, simply for stepping out for breakfast before check-out.\n\nFor travelers visiting Lyon, we strongly recommend considering alternative accommodations. There are excellent three-star options in the city that offer courteous, professional service and great value. For those seeking four- or five-star experiences, many quality choices are available in the area.
