The atmosphere is straight out of a Hemingway novel, and at first glance, it feels like stepping into another era.\n\nBut the service? Hit or miss. Some bartenders were fun and engaging, while others seemed distracted or even a little careless. I rolled with it, but one moment really stuck with me:\n\nI asked about a large framed portrait displayed prominently in the bar (you\u2019d think it had a story, right?). One server offhandedly said, \"Oh, that\u2019s my cousin,\" like it was a joke which felt dismissive. The front desk said they\u2019d ask the owner, but by checkout, no answer. It left me wondering\u2014if the staff doesn\u2019t care about the details, is the whole \"vintage charm\" just for show?\n\nFor a hotel that isn\u2019t cheap, it\u2019s surprising they don\u2019t polish the hospitality. The vibe is undeniably cool, but the lack of warmth and attention makes it feel more like a themed set than a place with real history.\n\nFinal verdict? Worth a drink for the atmosphere, but don\u2019t expect thoughtful service.", "time": 1749488969, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Sarah Garner", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102852898787319371396/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWwLj_FDPX3vf4vFpU9UfovKRRXxjDoqSh2pm2_kD-zyf7Ktpg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "Room Functionality and Storage\nWe booked a suite intended to accommodate four guests, although we would have preferred a standard room. Unfortunately, the suite (Wicket) was not adequately equipped for four people and seemed to be designed more as a hosting space for a couple/events vs to accommodate 4 (2 adults + 2 kids). The closet space was extremely minimal, with only five hangers and no drawers, leaving our kids who were using the second bed with no practical way to unpack (nor us). Despite requesting additional hangers on day one (received on day two after a reminder), the storage provided remained insufficient for even a short stay.\n\nHot Water Supply\nWe experienced persistent issues with the hot water. The water was warm but never hot, and the supply lasted only a few minutes with the first shower use (and not for any subsequent shower use for anyone else). This meant only one person could shower with warm water per day, and for three days, we had no hot showers. Although the issue was reported and checked, it was never resolved during our stay.\n\nSustainability?\nWe requested a carafe of water at the bar & restaurant which was available at other hotel touchpoints but denied at the bar and restaurant, where only disposable branded bottled water was offered. This inconsistency contradicts the hotel\u2019s stated commitment to sustainability.\n\nOn a positive note, we enjoyed the hotel\u2019s design aesthetic, the quality of the food, and the friendly reception team.\n\nWe shared our constructive feedback with the manager and requested a room rate adjustment due to the unsatisfactory experience; however, we were informed that the hotel does not respond to guest concerns or offer compensation, but that our feedback would be discussed internally for improvements.

The hotel is small, but has a number of nice sitting areas and lounges to socialize or work, a small cafe, and a nice bar in the evenings. Our room was great - spacious, bright, with a kitchenette and a small balcony. Our breakfast was included with the room and it was amazing every day. No need for a massive buffet, just all of the right things to have a healthy breakfast along with a gourmet a la carte menu, also included in the breakfast rate. So many hotels overdo this part of the experience, so it was nice to see how great it was. Excellent avocado toast and eggs benedict!\nWe spent a week at the hotel and used Milan as our base to visit surrounding cities, so we got to know the staff quite well, which is also a big selling point for the hotel. Everyone working the front desk and and breakfast area was always very friendly to us, even on the days when we admittedly arrived to breakfast just before closing ;-) Housekeeping was always very prompt to pick up laundry or deliver extra bottles of water to our room and pretty much everyone we encountered on the property was very friendly.\nI'd like to give a special mention to our ladies working the breakfast area - they do an amazing job every morning. The front desk staff was always helpful to answer questions, help with dinner reservations, book a taxi if we needed it, and just always took a personal approach to speak with us and other guests we also witnessed. A special mention to Edith who just happened to be on duty whenever we needed something and was always willing to help with a smile.
