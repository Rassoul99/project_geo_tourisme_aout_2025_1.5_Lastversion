Unfortunately, this time around, we were quite disappointed.\n\nAs expected, the food and cocktails were on the expensive side. The cocktails, however, were excellent\u2014every single one we ordered was well-crafted and delicious. The food was good\u2014tasty, fresh, nicely presented, and well-cooked\u2014but not particularly exceptional for the price. One notable service touch was the waiter continuously topping up bread baskets before they were empty and refilling both still and sparkling bottled water.\n\nWeeks before our visit, I had arranged a birthday surprise for my sister via email. I was given three options: a birthday cake, a Cavalli Special Dessert (a mix of small desserts and fruit served with sparklers), or a small dessert. I chose the Cavalli Special. The presentation was beautiful\u2014two large dessert platters arrived with sparklers and birthday signs, accompanied by birthday songs. The effort was certainly five-star.\n\nHowever, when the bill arrived, we were shocked to find we had been charged for two Cavalli Special Desserts instead of the one I requested. I was never informed of a price for the birthday dessert and was under the impression it was complimentary, as no cost was mentioned in the email correspondence. This unexpected charge was frustrating, especially since I had only requested one dessert, not two.\n\nOn top of that, we were charged for every bread basket that was continuously topped up without request, the bottled water that we didn\u2019t ask for, and even a cover charge for napkins and cutlery. These hidden charges significantly increased the bill and left a sour taste.\n\nTo make matters worse, four of us felt like we were being eaten alive by mosquitoes under the table. We were continuously itching throughout our meal and returned to the hotel to find numerous red bites all over our bodies. Even two weeks later, the bites are still visible and have left small marks. If the restaurant is aware of this issue, they should consider using some sort of deterrent to protect their guests.\n\nAnother disappointment was the state of the toilets. For such an upscale restaurant, with beautiful decor, building and gardens, the facilities in the bathroom were below standard, with broken hand dryers that didn\u2019t even work.\n\nWe were also told that after our meal, we could attend the club for free (which normally has an entry fee of around \u20ac15). However, after leaving our table and asking security how to enter the club, we were told it was closed. Instead, we were directed back inside the restaurant, where the atmosphere was supposed to shift into more of a \"club vibe.\" When we first arrived at 8 PM, the atmosphere was flat, with only a couple of other diners and uninspiring music from the DJ. Things did pick up around 10\u201310:30 PM as more guests arrived, but overall, the experience was underwhelming.\n\nUnfortunately, my second visit here did not live up to my first. While the drinks and presentation were excellent, the unexpected charges, mosquito bites, poor toilet facilities, and misleading club access made for a frustrating experience. I\u2019m not sure I would return.", "time": 1742403079, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Gourav Choudhary", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104620185493302091130/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLivFPMjmQZJRB7bh0xrhEpPf3_V9fDM6hMRmGk4BoplTV5SI4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "I want everyone who dont want to distroy their mood , please think twice to go to a club like this.

As i belong to other nationality (Asian) they didnt let me in and when i try to go in as a group they gave one ticket to my spanish friend and while they were giving me ticket they deliberately took the ticket from my hand.

Even i called police and they did nothing and said to me if i face such problem i should come to police station within 90 days  to file a compalin but i dont think it will work at all. I have been around the world in different parts of the europe and Uk but it never happened to me. Also i message to justme on instagram and told them about the incident but with a proof( video) and they saw it but didnt replied which states how bad and irresponsible the admistration is.

People who pay over 280\u20ac for a table are allowed inside and everyone else is standing outside watching through a glass window while other people are dancing. See pics. Really bad!\nps. They charge 5\u20ac for every piece they take at the wardrobe. Even a scarf.

I made the booking nearly a month in advance and was even provided a floor plan upon request.\n\nHowever, the table we were ultimately given bore no resemblance to the one shown in the floor plan. To make matters worse, the waiter repeatedly questioned who would cover the bill every time I stepped away, despite the fact that I had already paid \u20ac1,500 upfront. This unprofessionalism culminated in one of our group members paying an additional \u20ac1,100 out of frustration due to the waiter\u2019s persistent inquiries.\n\nThe crowd, the staff, and the overall atmosphere felt far from luxurious\u2014it was cheap, chaotic, and completely unsuitable for what should have been a proper celebration.\n\nI can confidently say: never again.", "time": 1725841574, "translated": false}], "serves_beer": true, "serves_vegetarian_food": true, "serves_wine": true, "takeout": false, "types": ["establishment", "food", "night_club", "point_of_interest", "restaurant"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=10290582548744460716", "user_ratings_total": 3468, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Torre Branca, Viale Luigi Camoens, 2, Milano", "website": "https://justmemilano.com/", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}
