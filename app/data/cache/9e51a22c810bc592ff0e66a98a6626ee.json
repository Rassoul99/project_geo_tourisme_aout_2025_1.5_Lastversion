It\u2019s also difficult to reach, as you have to pass through a strange passage with stairs or an elevator where people are often seen taking drugs.\n\nThe atmosphere inside feels chaotic. Large groups of tourists arrive at the same time, filling the lobby with crowds of people sitting around and waiting. The result is constant noise and overcrowding.\n\nThe hotel itself feels old and poorly maintained. The bathroom doors don\u2019t lock properly and sometimes open on their own. The bathrooms are so tiny that even young people struggle to get in and out of the shower, which could be dangerous for older guests.\n\nThere are no complimentary amenities such as coffee or a kettle in the room. Instead, there\u2019s only a coin-operated coffee machine, which is highly impractical for families or larger groups. There is a bar with drinks and coffee, but the staff were cold and unwelcoming\u2014so much so that it felt like they wanted us to leave immediately. We tried it once and avoided it afterwards.\n\nThe rooms are very small, and overall the experience was disappointing. We stayed at another Ibis in Paris at the beginning of our trip, and that hotel was excellent\u2014the complete opposite of this one.

If you\u2019re walking there at night, it\u2019s very dark and smells like urine.\n\nAs soon as I entered my room, I noticed it looked nothing like the pictures.

I woke up early, excited to fulfill a dream of visiting Disneyland \u2014 only for that dream to turn into a nightmare: BEDBUGS.

I left the hotel the next day.\n\nCommunication among the staff was terrible. When I returned from Disneyland to get the keys to my new room, they had no idea what I was talking about. No one showed any effort to provide recovery service or change my experience as a customer.\n\nAnyway, they eventually gave me another room \u2014 but I was too traumatized to sleep in the bed.

The TV remote didn\u2019t work either \u2013 turns out the battery had corroded inside. Gross.\n\nThe windows were dirty, the room felt old and neglected, and the bathroom had no door, which meant the entire floor got soaked after every shower.
