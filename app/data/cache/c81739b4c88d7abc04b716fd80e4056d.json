The location is excellent \u2014 all major sights are within walking distance, even with young children. There are plenty of shops nearby, and a supermarket just around the corner, which was very convenient. Despite being in the middle of the city, the hotel itself was remarkably quiet and peaceful \u2014 something we really appreciated after a busy day in town.\n\nThe hotel offers its own underground parking garage, which, by city standards, is just spacious enough to park comfortably. After a long day exploring the city, taking a dip in the pool was the perfect way to unwind. For our kids, it quickly became the highlight of each day.\n\nOur room was spacious and well-equipped, including a small kitchen. The children slept on a large sofa bed, while we had a separate bedroom with comfortable beds. One minor downside was the shower in the bathtub \u2014 at 1.85 meters tall, I couldn't stand upright underneath it.\n\nBreakfast included all the standard items you'd expect, but given the relatively high price, we found it a bit expensive for what was offered. A small suggestion for improvement: adding some bacon to the selection would be a welcome touch.\n\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed both the hotel and the city. We can warmly recommend this place to any family looking for a relaxed and central stay in Toulouse!", "time": 1753027139, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Ervin Hysa", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100074273287441227976/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUFEKZ6UjDrKxIh7UZzuNqNAuMH57GjTzB8GG7guQC06c2Jrrhf=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "I had a wonderful experience with Manuella.
