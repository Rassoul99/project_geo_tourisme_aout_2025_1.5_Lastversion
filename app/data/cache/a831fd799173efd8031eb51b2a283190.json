The only positives, were the kind staff. As someone who has been working in the hotel business, the room I was given, DOES NOT, meet the expectations of a 3-star hotel. To start off, when I first walked in the room and sat on the bed, I immediately noticed multiple discolorations and stains on the sheets. I have a photo linked below. Next, I went to plug in my charger into the outlet below the lamp, without realizing the cover was completely missing from it. I almost got electrocuted as it sparked up, causing me to quickly pull back. The bathroom door doesnt shut all the way, no matter how much you pull and turn the knob. One of the lamps next to the bed does not turn on. The refrigerator was not cleaned properly and there is gunk towards the back of it. The cups have some sort of powder residue on them. The breakfast was fine, mainly consisting of croissants, cereal, fruits, and yogurt. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. They were knowledgable about the area and were very kind to us. I would have asked for a room change, if I hadn't been informed that they were fully booked upon checking in. I stayed for a total of three nights and would not stay here again. The price does not match the quality. There are many other hotels nearby for much better prices, that im sure, would not have such a low bar for cleanliness. In the end, I would not personally recommend this hotel. If a manager would like to reach out to be regarding my stay, that would be lovely. Or if there is an email I can contact, that works too.", "time": 1758183118, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Jay Jay", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103254955626817291944/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWnWq1ly0k8RBfDckbowdsIqp6h0TRgEo2AKPqji1v26uubWy8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "The hotel is clean and the staff are exceptionally good, polite and helpful.
