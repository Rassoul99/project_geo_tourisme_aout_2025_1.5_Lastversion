We arrived early and left our bags. We did not check the arrangement of our rooms and we now know this was an error. When we arrived back in the evening. Neither room offered were twins. The young man at the desk did his best to help and got one room (we were friends sharing and one friend was pregnant so this was important to us to try to resolve). He advised to try and change the other room in the morning. Our double room was much smaller but had a balcony. With a tiny view of Eiffel Tower. There is a rood top terrace with a much better view of the Tower and Basilica so the balcony is not always necessary especially if you want more space but we did use the balcony. Especially as we were told we could not change the room. The lady at the desk said the young man was new and was wrong to have tried to change but we certainly appreciated his help, I'm sorry I didn't get his name as he was doing a fantastic job in our opinion.\nWe didn't have breakfast at the hotel but overall we were satisfied with our stay despite the confusion. The location is great. Near a subway and the Basilica. It's no way near as rough as some reviews had made out, we were really happy to walk about together and had no concerns. I would recommend for value and if you want to stay in this area.
