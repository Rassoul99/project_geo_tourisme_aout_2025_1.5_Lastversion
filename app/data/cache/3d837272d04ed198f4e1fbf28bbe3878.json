I thought it might be fun to try the restaurant that was the preface for the romantic climax of 2003's \"Something's Gotta Give\". Playing an accomplished playwright, Diane Keaton wanted to celebrate her birthday at her favorite restaurant. What was nice was how this place looked and felt sophisticated and cinematic much like it was portrayed in the movie.\n\nAt the same time, tables were not scrunched together (like at Bofinger, for example) and it didn't feel all that stuffy. What was funny was that the menu cover stated \"Diner Menu\", which made me immediately think of a greasy spoon although the term 'diner' actually means 'dinner'. My French sucks. However, my confusion was not fully misplaced because shortly after we sat at our table, a small bowl of freshly crisp potato chips arrived along with a ramekin of marinated olives.\n\nWe started with our cocktail of choice, the 15\u20ac\nEspresso Martinis, which we agreed were among the best we ever had. That might explain why we soon had a second round. The warm rustic bread arrived next with a typically crunchy crust and a soft middle which we slathered with their fresh butter. This led to the appetizers. My husband ordered the 21\u20ac Whole Artichoke Heart which sat on a bed of arugula salad and was topped with a mound of Parmesan shavings.\n\nI had never seen a heart that big on a plate. Quite refreshing with nice contrasts in texture. I went full Franco and ordered the 25\u20ac Burgundy Large Escargots. There were nine plump ones in my order, and they were thoroughly delicious and not at all too chewy as they were soaked liberally in garlic butter. The snails were too big for the fancy pinchers they provided, but I speared them easily with the cocktail fork. Our entrees were even more masterfully prepared.\n\nMy husband had the 31 \u20ac Risotto with Crispy Zucchinis and Prawns. The dish was a creamy delight with five succulent prawns accompanied by zucchini and arugula. I went for the 33\u20ac Braised Beef slowly cooked for seven hours and topped with braised carrots and parsley. So tender, much like an amazing pot roast, it could've fallen off the bone if there was a bone. It was accompanied by decadently creamy mashed potatoes and an add-on of buttery 8\u20ac Green Beans.\n\nDiscretion be damned, however, as we went for dessert. Wanting to replicate the near-perfect floating island he had at Bofinger, my husband ordered the 14\u20ac Floating Island. The meringue was not quite as airy, but the creme anglaise was a winner. I wanted a showy end to my meal and ordered the 18\u20ac Baked Alaska, a delightful rendition of the traditional ice cream cake. It was stylishly flambed with rum. Dessert engulfed in a blue flame is what I call panache. In fact, the whole evening was quite amazing.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...classic French dishes executed with panache and satisfying flavors\nCOCKTAILS - 5 stars...the espresso martinis were impeccable\nAMBIANCE - 5 stars...genuinely photogenic with a surprising sense of intimacy amid the packed tables...it's no wonder movies are shot in here\nSERVICE - 5 stars...attentive, responsive, and ingratiating\nTOTAL - 5 stars...if you're looking for the ideal Parisian dining experience, this be it", "time": 1757694643, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Dariusz Mdra", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105599790423603767723/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVyTx3J1WkKu8uGOqkcEFe12GyUwYj_jloOH8DU-9Bq-zexVSg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Well after few hours of walking in the louvre museum we decided to check traditional and famous dishes.
