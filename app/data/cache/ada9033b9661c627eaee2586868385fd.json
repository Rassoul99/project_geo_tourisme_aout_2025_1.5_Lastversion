always known for luxury, but the Milan property is on another level.\n\nDuring our month-long trip across Europe (France \u2192 UK \u2192 Italy), we stayed at Park Hyatt hotels in Paris and London as Globalist. Milan, however, stood out the most. The team was outstanding! From the moment we arrived, the concierge gave us a warm welcome and even remembered our names throughout the stay. I also highly appreciated the front desk staff, who went the extra mile to fulfill my request for a room with a vanity table. After weeks of traveling, having a spacious bathroom and closet was exactly what I needed to refresh\u2014doing my nails, tidying up, and enjoying a relaxing bubble bath.\n\nWe stayed 4 days and 3 nights, trying the restaurant for a birthday dinner, the bar for happy hour, and of course their signature breakfast. Every experience was excellent and reflected the best of Italian hospitality\u2014stylish, warm, and full of character.\n\nNo wonder so many people say Park Hyatt Milan is the best in the group\u2014I couldn\u2019t agree more, and I\u2019d highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city.", "time": 1758030365, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Badewa King", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107710357130614499909/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVN2h2JyqfmdeI_JNjK6C0YY19ujZUDR3bpCJynBUXgCy6nrozQYw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "I visited the Park Hyatt in Milan for lunch with my family, and the experience was extremely disappointing. From the moment we were seated, the service was shockingly poor.

What made it worse was the clear difference in how we were treated compared to other guests\u2014it felt borderline racist. We were made to feel invisible. My young son was hungry and restless, and no one made any effort to check on us or acknowledge the situation.\n\nMy wife voiced her complaints directly to staff, making it clear that we were unhappy with how we were being treated. Despite this, no one seemed to care. Even the manager, while polite, offered no genuine apology or meaningful resolution.\n\nEventually, we had no choice but to walk out. We went to enjoy lunch elsewhere\u2014somewhere we were treated with basic respect.\n\nThis kind of experience is unacceptable at any establishment, let alone one carrying the Hyatt name.
