This boutique hotel had a great photographer so we felt okay about booking it on the website beforehand. After arrival at realized our rookie mistake.\n\nYes the rooms are so small. This was expected because it\u2019s Europe but other issues made our stay very uncomfortable.\nThe room is under 2 feet wide on either side of a queen bed. You cannot completely open two full suitcases in the room. You can open one but won\u2019t be able to go around it and you\u2019re stuck in that spot until it\u2019s zipped up and pushed to the side.  The bathroom was fine but the towels were teeny and thin.\nThere\u2019s a large built in cabinet that takes up a big section of the room I had (on the main floor) with a desk that has no chair so it was unusable.\n\nHere is where the hotel and staff could\u2019ve fixed some issues. As I was getting ready a 3x3 foot bathroom tile slid off the vanity and hit my shin. They had flimsily taped a massive tile to an under sink pipe that fell off and hit me. Meaning they knew this tile was not secured and used tape. Tape to hold it in place.\n\nNext, my room\u2019s hairdryer did not work, which they were aware of and did not fix before we arrived nor did they fix during our visit. I had to go out and buy a hairdryer. I did not bring one from home because their listings specifically state that they provide hairdryers\n\nThe tiny ancient TV never worked.\n\nLastly, they claimed they have air-conditioning, which they do not. They have a vent fan.  My nights were spent sweating.\n\nAnother space issue: It was very difficult to use the 2\u2018 x 2 1/2\u2018 wide elevator during my stay, my very small stroller and I barely fit in. It\u2019s extremely small. The breakfast is located in the basement and is very sparse.
