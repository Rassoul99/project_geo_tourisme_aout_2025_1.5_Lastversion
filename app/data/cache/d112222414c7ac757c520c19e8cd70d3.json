"relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "BED BUG INFESTATION\nFour friends and I currently occupy an apartment on Rue Montlosier, and this very evening we discovered that the apartment was infested with bedbugs. After discovering that my body was covered in bites, we inspected the apartment and found enormous bedbugs (with photo/video evidence).\nWe demand a refund for the nights' stay, as well as reimbursement for the expenses incurred to disinfect our belongings and cars.\n\nGiven the health and psychological emergency posed by bedbugs, I tried to contact Lion Immobilier all night. After receiving no response, I went to their headquarters, which is a room converted into a laundry room. This isn't about complaining about the lack of toilet paper, but about raising awareness of a health and psychological hazard. I clearly stated our demands. The laundry employee barely knows what a bedbug is (odd given her field) and explains to me that the apartment has never had a bedbug problem. I explain to her (with supporting evidence) that there are both dead and live bedbugs, proof that the eradication has been unsuccessful. She believes it was one of the housekeepers who doesn't know the procedures and failed to raise the alarm about the apartment's unsanitary condition. At what point can anyone believe this excuse is valid? As a housing and hygiene professional, you are required to have precise procedures for excrement disposal. This lapse in procedures is extremely worrying for customer safety...\n\nAt that point, and I wouldn't find out until later, the work-study secretary overheard my conversation with this employee and noticed my body was ravaged by bedbugs. At no point did she introduce herself as her boss's secretary, who, incidentally, sends subordinates to answer questions that aren't within their purview. A strategy that's sad to see for a man who positions himself as the head of a company.\nThe boss tells his laundry employee that I need to send an email and that we will receive 50% of the total refund for the advanced nights. This is a scandal. We are not responsible for the unsanitary condition of the apartment. We are victims of his dishonesty. The message is clear: he is refusing our requests.\nLater, this secretary calls me around 3:00 p.m., even though she saw me at 8:00 a.m. in the laundry room. A heated exchange ensues because, at first, she refuses to state her position and hierarchical position. After calling me \"intern,\" I finally got her to say she was the secretary and therefore in a higher position than the laundry employee. Why, then, would we let a subordinate manage a health hazard of this magnitude? The secretary stammered and didn't know how to answer.\nWhile I was asserting our rights, she let slip that the landlord was aware of the bedbug infestation and had cleaned it up... an ineffective cleanup, as evidenced by the damage to my body. The laundry employee and the secretary were already at odds... Strange. We're forced to pay out money to repair the damage caused by Lion Immobilier's greed.\nWe have a multitude of photos and videos of the bedbugs, which are extremely large.\n\nShe hung up on me because I wouldn't let go of the issue of refunds. I have the call log as proof, because I tried to call her back. She didn't bother to answer. I left a voicemail explaining that it was disrespectful of her to hang up on me and that she needed to call me back given the health and psychological risks. She never returned my call.\n\nLion Immobilier is required by law to provide decent housing. Lion Immobilier treats us in a disrespectful and inhumane manner.", "time": 1754851781, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Jim Caq", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104600465329999257217/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "fr", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLGg4noLYprjQNCR5pakSn4xengHKHAc0h3bRWmaunQ_98ZuQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Accommodation faithful to the description, good support to ensure everything goes smoothly.
