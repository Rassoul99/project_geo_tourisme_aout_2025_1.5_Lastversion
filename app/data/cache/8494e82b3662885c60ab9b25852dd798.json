Secret de Paris is inspired to the city's most famous monuments and features some typical French design elements, such as the \"Confident\" sofa, where nobles used to sit to whisper secrets. I stayed in the Trocadero room, but there are many interesting categories (Moulin Rouge; Tour Eiffel; Op\u00e8ra Garnier; Mus\u00e8e d'Orsay). My room was well equipped with a super comfortable bed, a desk for working and a speaker for playing music. The toilet featured a two-seats Jacuzzi which was a true delicacy after having spent the whole day walking and running around. The breakfast is served in the main lounge and has a variety of French delicacies and international options (special mention for their yoghurt). I tried the SPA and had my best time there: reserved just for me and my mom, we relaxed in the Jacuzzi (you can even choose the lighting in the room!), took a breath in the saunas and refreshed in the emotional showers. The whole staff was amazing, helping us in identifying the best means of transportation to go here and there and telling us the story of the hotel in every detail - it's evident that they love the place and their job. The hotel is located in a super well connected area: 15 mins walking from Moulin Rouge and especially 5-10 mins walking from 3 different metro stations and several bus/tram stops. Moreover, it's full of nice typical restaurants around it - give a try to Chez Papa or, if you prefer international kitchen (Italian, in this case), go the famouse Pink Mamma.
