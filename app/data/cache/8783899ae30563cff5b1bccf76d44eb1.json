To explain what happened:\n\n4 of us were dining there. nobody liked the food we got. my friend who barely complain on food ever said it was really bad there. I, who ordered cut of meat already knew something was wrong because of the smell of the meat. I couldn\u2019t chew on it. I don\u2019t remember to get such bad cut of meat ever with so much membranes I couldn\u2019t even cut it. It was late, we were tired, waited already long. We ate what we could, I just touched salad and french fries and left the meat. Guy came to take plates and asked me if I didn\u2019t like it and to explain why. I confirmed, and said smell, taste and chewy texture was really bad for me. He made face like I insulted him, I didn\u2019t want any scene, just wanted go to bed so I said \u201abut that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not a problem\u2019 and he said \u201awell I don\u2019t have any problem\u2019. LOL. arrogant :)\n\nyou should mister. because you serve disgusting food and you yet have the audacity to act like spoiled brat. I really don\u2019t like people who shouldn\u2019t be serving people due to lack of knowledge on how to serve. \u201ayou don\u2019t have any problem\u2019? lol! neither do I. there would be more business trips and surely holiday Inn won\u2019t be my/our choice if you acting like annoyed kid. grow up. learn how to take criticism and pass it to the chefs. as simple as that.", "time": 1740087141, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Amanda Michelle", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116752296778349390768/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX9YRTOCjKdt3WIpWEhnGhXsmaG5FHP0uhVA43vClylNkZuB-nkjA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Disgusting hotel.
