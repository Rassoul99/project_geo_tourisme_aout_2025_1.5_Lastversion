But if you\u2019re looking to use the hotel facilities throughout the day then that\u2019s on you to pay for a hotel with more facilities.

Staff were not friendly, but were polite.\n+ There is a very large flea market near the hotel, with lots of vendors of all sorts of things, and a few food options.\n\nThe negatives:\n-The area around the Ibis was a rough neighborhood that is undergoing gentrification, so in a few years, the area is more likely to be a nicer experience.  I would NOT recommend this location for a solo female traveler for safety reasons.\n-The Ibis staff informed us that they do not have Air Conditioning, but rather an 'Air Cooling System.'  However, despite the weather during our stay being mostly cloudy and rainy, with highs of 28-29C, inside the room got very hot.  Opening the window allowed some fresh air, but because it is so close to the freeway, it is unbearably LOUD and almost impossible to sleep due to not only the vehicular traffic, but also all of the people (possibly homeless) on the streets around the properly, who made noise at all hours of the day and night.  The staff were kind enough to lend us a fan for our room, but in the Parisian heat, I would NOT recommend this location unless you want to sleep in a sauna.\n- The Ibis lobby was, at times, VERY full and disorganized with guests.  Directly outside of the lobby doors, were all sorts of debris and trash left by either the market or the homeless people in the neighborhood.  (It also smelled of urine, unfortunately.)\n- There are no hand towels provided.  You must use your bath towel, and the sink for the room was located near the window, but the shower was located near the door.  It was very impractical not to have even one hand towel to share between two people (and the room had occupancy up to three people).\n-There is only ONE wall plug, which made it inconvenient for two people to share the room.  There was another outlet near the sink, but it was not safe to charge electronics so close to the sink, and without anywhere safe to place your electronics (away from water) while charging.", "time": 1755288647, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Vinketha Gansalves", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107965031007785469847/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUTB3o6J0PCG6LAFO_VN8A0CJsyzF2l9TNH4Wx1DEsSc50H3WsnWA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Disappointing Stay \u2013 Not Ideal for Couples\n\nWe had low expectations given it\u2019s a budget hotel, but even those weren\u2019t met.\n\nPros:\n\u2022\tStaff were polite and service was okay.\n\u2022\tGood transport connections nearby.\n\nCons:\n\u2022\tThe hotel is quite rundown.
