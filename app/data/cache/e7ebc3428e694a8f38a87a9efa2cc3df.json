It was supposed to be cheap and on that I agree. Bad impression from the start. Neighbourhood scares at first, especially if you're coming from M13 Saint Ouen under the bridge. Anyway, the hotel looks bad. Outside and inside, the walls were dirty, and the paint in rooms scratched off, a hole on the hallway, etc. Supposedly, they have construction on site form 8.30-16.30 cool. I've been reading a good few reviews on this hotel, and they've been saying the same thing going on 5 months ago, so maybe before making a decision, call in and check if they're done. People have also been saying that heating and air conditioning weren't working. True. The first 3 days were hot, and opening the window wouldn't help. After that colder temperatures like 12-7\u00b0C and then, it was a bit too cold in the room. One of the rooms had an electric heater. Not comfortable. On the first entry, there was a bucket at the reception set to catch leaking water from air conditioning or maybe sth else ? \ud83e\udd14\nSome comments say that it's a good place if you're just enjoying the city and come back to get some sleep (got to admit that I had clean bed sheets every day). Right if you don't have any guests around you who live their lives to the fullest. You gonna hear everything \ud83d\ude09 and especially construction going on from 8.30, very thin walls. Entering the room was annoying. I had to reset the room card every day at least once. Take the room on the 1st floor because the lift works a bit roughly. It has issues with closing the doors.\nThe location is good. You have Subway, Lidl, and plenty of other things around. The room service is a bit too eager to clean the room. I had left kid's sandals under the table where there was a small bin placed as well. They've got thrown out. Not nice \ud83d\ude15 I had also a transparent zipped plastic bag of creams (they're for only available on perception) my 7yr old child's skin disease placed on top of little bin in bathroom because there wasn't much space at all to put them. They've been thrown out as well. I asked in reception but no luck :/\nAnd last thing about the toilet.
