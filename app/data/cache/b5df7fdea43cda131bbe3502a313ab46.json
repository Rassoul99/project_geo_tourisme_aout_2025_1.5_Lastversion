The double bed was comfortable, as was the sofa bed for our daughter. Obviously not massively spacy, but very good for Parisien standards.\n\nCleaning was done every day, including fresh towels (even replacing the ones we hung on a hook).\n\nBreakfast was surprisingly good (especially after reading the negative reviews). Fresh bread and croissant/pain au chocolat, couple of different fresh cheeses, good coffee, juices, yoghurt etc. Also scrambled egg and sausage, but we didn't try that. Proper French breakfast.\n\nThe area is fine. Yes it is Barb\u00e8s, so very lively (maybe a bit of a shock to people who live in a gated compound), but we never felt unsafe. Metro is very close, as is Gare du Nord, so very convenient.\n\nNo issues with credit cards or anything, and we were not asked for a 100 eur deposit either.\n\nThere is indeed no lift, so keep that in mind. If you have difficulty climbing stairs I would not recommend staying here.\n\nAs for noise, yes there is some, but mostly from the street outside. This is quite common in Paris though.
