The location is good, close to the river and notre dame, and central for other attractions if you don't mind a little walking.\nAt check in it was obvious straight from the start there might be issues.\nThe receptionist was looking for the key to room 26 for us, didn't find it, turns out they overbooked, and gave us room 25.\nI had paid upfront for superior double, the room they put us in was a standard. Dark and smelled musty, and someones hat still left in the closet. Somebody else might not have said anything but I definitely had to. I went to reception, told them I paid for superior and it definitely was not what I had been given.\nAt that point he said there was no other room available and nothing we could do, he would raise it with the manager of the hotel. The first reception man did actually seem like genuinely felt disappointed for us, and he didn't know what to do bless him. He was at least trying.\nWe went out, feeling upset and disappointed and considered insisting on a full refund as not what we paid for and trying to find somewhere else, but when we got back after a little walk the reception man told us he spoke to manager and we would be moved to superior the next day, refunded 50% of the first night and given a bottle of champagne by means of apology.\nWe accepted and although it meant the first night we were unsettled and unhappy, couldn't relax, at least we didn't have to panic about finding a room anywhere else.\nBreakfast was complimentary, basic, cheese, bread, yogurt, egg, not the most amazing quality but we don't eat much first thing anyway. The coffee was good, and we didn't get told about the complimentary water so didn't use that facility.\nThe next day we were moved to s superior room which was much nicer. Colourful and windows facing the street. Bathroom toiletries are basic, and tea and coffee and small kettle provided. We could unpack and relax a bit at last.\nAfter night 3 , on our day out in paris I recieved a number of phone calls and an email to say we were to vacate our room! I told them I paid for 4 nights! When we arrived back at the hotel the reception lady just said its sorted, but there had obviously been another confusion regarding the booking systems they use at this hotel. I didn't feel as though this hotel tries to look after it's guests on a personal level, I felt more like they overbooked and hoped they can pass of standards as superior.\nThe cleanliness was OK, not perfect, under the bed very dusty and high mirrors dusty, and the door to our room was left unlocked after cleaning. Room 22, the door needs to be pulled tight to shut properly.\nThe lift was working fine.\nWe enjoyed out anniversary break in paris.\nThe hotel could definitely have been better in my opinion.\nMy advice would be to not overbook guests in future.", "time": 1745695169, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Tom\u00e1s de J.

We arrived from the UK in the evening (around 11 PM), exhausted from our journey, only to be met with an appalling lack of hospitality at the front desk. The receptionist, who appeared to be of Indian origin (no bias of course), was unhelpful and outright dismissive, refusing to address even our most basic inquiries. Instead of providing essential information about the hotel's services (such as details about the breakfast included in our reservation), she seemed entirely disinterested in her work and more focused on her mobile phone. The check-in process was frustrating and unwelcoming, setting an unfortunate tone for the rest of our stay.\n\nHaving paid a hefty sum (over \u00a32,500 for one weekend), we expected a truly Parisian experience, to the lengths of explicitly requesting, prior to booking, the highly advertised pink upstairs suite. However, the level of service fell far below the standard one would anticipate from a hotel of this calibre.\n\nThe room seemed just briefly glossed-over when it came to cleanliness (long dark hair in the sink, towels randomly placed on the floor of the shower cabin, complimentary tray with tea/coffee not stocked).\n\nGiven this unprofessional experience, we cannot, in good conscience, recommend staying in this hotel.
