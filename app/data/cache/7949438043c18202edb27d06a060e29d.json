I thought to treat myself in Paris with a nicer place and I was able to stay a night at this hotel for a very reasonable rate. The staff member, Yulia, was happy to answer my questions and assist me, which gave me a great impression of friendliness before I even arrived.\nThe room was absolutely wonderful; cozy, and it has everything you need. Most importantly - the vibe and atmosphere, with the wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower from the top floor. I had hoped for this from my Paris experience and this hotel delivered beyond what I had come here expecting. It is located in an area well connected with public transport (except late in the night); walkable distance from the Eiffel Tower (you can see it and just follow the road). It\u2019s near the main road but tucked in a quieter street so the perfect blend of suburban while being in the city centre.\nIn fact, the room was so nice I would have almost wanted to just move in there permanently. Definitely two of the best nights I\u2019ve spent on my Europe trip.\n\nA couple minor details; but nothing that majorly detracted from the experience:\n- there were some small strange stains on the sheets, perhaps not properly cleaned out\n- the keys are a bit fiddly, it took quite a few rotations to unlock the door.\n- lift is small, but they state this upfront on their website, and I saw that the staff member was happy to help someone with luggage.\n\nI think this place is a perfect example of \u2018the little things count\u2019, the management clearly considers delivering the best guest experience to the guests; I especially appreciate the little tea bags and additions in the room, and the tea time is a great touch - the cream cheese and scallion is simple but some of the best French finger food ever.\nAll the staff members were very helpful and in general very well supplied when I needed a couple extra amenities, and this went a long way. I would definitely want to swing back here the next time I\u2019m back in Paris (I will be!) and I\u2019d definitely recommend it to others.
