Hairs from someone else on your new bed linens? Holes from cigarettes in the bedding? You got them all here. There was a water puddle in our room when we checked in and after day 3 it\u2019s still not cleaned. Even when we throw the dirty towels right next to it. Maybe the staff wants us to keep it.\nThe windows and walls are thin so you hear everything. From flushing the toilet, showering or from the busy street outside.\nWhat killed it was the service. We are paying for your rooms so we expect some kind of service and friendliness. I sent a mail to the front desk with some tickets which needed to be printed. I went down and asked if they could print the tickets I just sent them and the guy there told me that I didn\u2019t ask him beforehand. I\u2019m flabbergasted that I have to ask the front desk for permission before sending them a mail.

The hotel is located on top of a bar that plays music all night. For 5 nights we slept poorly. Everytime we returned to the room at night the windows were open and there was a faint smell of cigarette smoke. The shower had no door and the shower head was uncomfortably low. The ameneties were two thin shampoo/soap packets with a bar of soap and nothing more. The window handle in the bathroom was broken but we were still able to shut it. On one side of the bed the outlets and the lamp didn't work, as well as another outlet in the bathroom. The chair had a rip in it. There was no AC but there was a small heating unit that took forever to make the room warm.
