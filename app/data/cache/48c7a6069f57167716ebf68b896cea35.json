A real highlight was the thoughtful offering of free tea, coffee, and water all day, along with pain au chocolat and croissants - a lovely touch for guests coming and going.\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. When we checked in, the guy at the desk went above and beyond by proactively changing our room from the ground floor to a higher level, suggesting the upper rooms were nicer. We were placed on the 3rd floor. Our room was small, as is typical for Paris, but we had plenty of space to move around. It was well-equipped with chargers on each side of the bed, places to hang clothes, a desk, and a TV. We noted the absence of a safe and air conditioning, but neither bothered us during our September visit.\nThe most important feature for a good trip is sleep, and the bed was really comfortable with soft bedding, ensuring we both had a great night's rest.\nThe bathroom was clean and modern. Being on the third floor, the shower took a little while to warm up, but once it did, it was lovely with great pressure.\nThere are a couple of points for light sleepers to bear in mind: the walls are thin, so you can hear people coming and going on your floor. Additionally, the maid service can start early and be noisy. We came prepared and took ear plugs, which meant neither issue disturbed our sleep.\nOverall, the hotel was great value for the price we paid. However, a friend who was assigned our original ground-floor room had a less positive experience. Based on this, I would strongly recommend requesting a room on a higher floor upon booking, as rooms on the ground floor or basement are apparently much noisier.\nWe had a lovely stay and would recommend the Korner Hotel for a central location in Montmartre. While we likely won't return, only because we'd like to experience a different area of Paris next time, the hotel itself provided a comfortable and good value stay.", "time": 1759404323, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Sarah Considine", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108912733751912054680/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW0gx1bhw7sby1NOtOc_qBnWoCWhE-N6a8Ptk0qNkZNo4i2Kbk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Pros: excellent location, complimentary tea/coffee/juice/water, kept our bags before check-in so we could explore the city and same with after checking out.\n\nCons: make sure to request a room on a higher floor, we got a basement room and it wasn\u2019t great. There\u2019s no air-con in the hotel and the basement was hot. It averaged around 20 degrees (Celsius) during our stay so I can\u2019t imagine how uncomfortable it would get at the height of summer. Our two large windows opened directly onto the hotel\u2019s courtyard that could be accessed by any guest, and there was no safety lock on the windows; if we wanted some fresh air, they had to be fully open which obviously is not safe at all. On their website it says they offer fans; unfortunately, that\u2019s not true. When we asked for one, receptionist told us she doesn\u2019t know why the website says that and that she had no fans to give us.
