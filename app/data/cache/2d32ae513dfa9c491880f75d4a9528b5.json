We paid \u20ac65 for one night, room for four. I was a little sceptical given the reviews but thought I\u2019d give it a go anyways and we were pleasantly surprised. Our experience really wasn\u2019t as bad as others and I\u2019ve seen far worse hotels for less value for money.\n\nQuick breakdown below:\n\n-Receptionist and staff were very kind and helpful.\n-The room was very clean and we checked the mattresses, I confirm there was no bed bugs and they were clean.\n-The room was on the first floor and overlooking the street but windows are double glazed so we did not hear any noise and it isn\u2019t a busy street anyways.\n-Room size was good for Paris and beds were comfortable (and we\u2019re difficult with beds!)\n-Bathroom was ok, a little small and yes water from the shower does splash but not that much if you\u2019re careful.\n-Location was great, cute streets and quiet and no it\u2019s not a \u201cdangerous\u201d area, unless you go a bit more into Pigalle but that\u2019s to be expected so research Pigalle if you don\u2019t know Paris well. We just avoided that area at night with our young girls and it was perfectly fine.\n-The room had aircon which was great.\n\nBad points:\n-I found a cockroach in the shower, which I killed and didn\u2019t tell the children about. Not nice but it must have crawled through the shower drain given our room was on the first floor, and for Paris, it can sometimes happen.  I put a towel on top of the drain and no more cockroaches appeared.\n-The walls are very thin and you do hear the noisy other rooms but unless they demolish all walls and rebuild them I\u2019m not sure what else the hotel can do.\n-Chairs in the room are old and ugly, could be replaced.\n-The cleaner knocked at 9am and even if I replied in French (as I speak French) that we were sleeping, she entered anyway and apologised afterwards.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to give a detailed breakdown of our experience to help future guests. But overall we were very happy especially for the price (\u20ac20pp) we paid. You probably won\u2019t find a better option for cheaper in the city centre at a peak period. So no, it isn\u2019t a lush hotel but if you just need a room to sleep in not too far from anything and would rather keep your money for shopping and activities then it\u2019s definitely a good option!\n\nI\u2019d like to think my review is objective as I\u2019m a demanding person who likes comfort, nice things, great service and never hesitate to speak my mind or complain.", "time": 1756373327, "translated": false}], "types": ["establishment", "lodging", "point_of_interest"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=8456262858971343435", "user_ratings_total": 861, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "6 Rue Victor Mass\u00e9, Paris", "website": "http://www.hoteldeturin.com/", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}
