The location is great. The service is as bad as it gets. We were in the city for a conference for a week and multiple times we've had horrible interactions with the service desk stopping us, blocking our room cards, etc because of various things they can't keep track of at their end. We were a group of business people who's costs were fully covered beforehand. They're behavior is extremely poor towards their customers. If I could go back in time I would've never booked this place. We had already paid for the whole stay. Such a shame. The last interaction that made me write this review is that they blocked our cards to our rooms 2 days left of our stay so that we can't access our room or stuff because we had not paid the city tax, which they had told us we should \"pay at checkout no problem\".
