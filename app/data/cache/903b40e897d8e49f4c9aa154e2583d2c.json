I couldn\u2019t sleep all night because my car had valuable equipment inside.\n\nAs for the room, I have never in my life seen a hotel room so filthy and so tiny.\nBreakfast was a complete disaster.

The bed was absolutely awful (old mattress or pad felt like laying on a table) and the elevators were both out of order on the last day. One was down for a couple of days prior, but they apparently did not rush to get it fixed until the other one went down. I felt bad for anyone on higher floors - at least mine was just the 4th floor. Still super inconvenient with luggage. The bathroom was super tiny and you really need to bring your own soap and shampoo - they provide some sort of hybrid soap mix but nothing for towels other than bath towels. The breakfast buffet was okay, nothing remarkable but not bad for the price. And the hotel is very well located near a tram stop, a couple blocks from the Part Dieu train station, and a few bus stops. Plus there was a huge mall across the street and Monoprix just down the street a block or two.\n\nAgain, the staff were nothing but remarkable and very helpful. Sleep was difficult for me because of the awful bed. And while small, the bathroom was functional and the cleaning staff did a nice job, too.\n\nRESPONSE to Response from Hotel:\n\nObviously I would have no idea how old the mattress is, so my assumption that it was old may be incorrect. But it was still like sleeping on a mat for me; there are certainly other people who do not mind a super firm-feeling mattress. That is not for me. And, yes, I am assuming that my \"Sweet Bed by IBIS\" mattress would be like all the other mattresses if they are all less than 3 years old.\n\nI also realize that the staff contacted someone quickly to get the 2nd elevator fixed - and I did not ask about the 1st elevator that had gone out a day or two beforehand. I fully understand that you are not elevator technicians and rely on a vendor for repairs.\n\nI did mention several positive factors for the hotel including the wonderful staff. My issues were primarily the bed and both elevators being out of order - which we all understand is not under the control of the hotel. But there was also no attempt at even providing a free breakfast buffet ticket for the inconvenience of having to go up and down the stairs and the final time with luggage.\n\nThese are meant to be honest reviews and that is what I have provided.
