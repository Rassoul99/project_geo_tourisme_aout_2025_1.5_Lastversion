Well positioned hotel within a short 6-8 min walk to Gare du Nord train station (and similarly close to Gare de L\u2019est train station) which takes you to the Charles De Gaulle airport, or also the same train station where you can catch the Chunnel train to England). Hotel is on a quiet side street and the rooms were quiet. Beautiful decor in this small boutique feeling hotel. Great AC for the summer too (and nice windows that open), Loved the suite because it had 2 separate small rooms (one had a pull out sleeper couch with a kitchenette (with mini fridge, stove, pans, electric kettle (with coffee and tea provided), utensils, plates and glasses) to cook in. Cute little bistro table by the window to have your coffee. Bottled water, safe, and slippers. In Paris, rooms tend to be smaller in general compared to American sizes, the rooms were well thought out and worked. Again with the \u201csuite\u201d we reserved, to have a mini kitchen and 2 separate rooms was fantastic for a family.\n\nLocation wise, this is a perfect hotel to catch the Regional train to CDG airport (which takes 30 minutes from Gare du Nord and leaves about every 15-20 minutes depending on the day). Again it\u2019s a short 6-8 minute walk to Gare du Nord train station from the hotel).\n\nAbout the area near Gare Du Nord-it\u2019s busy and feels a little sketch with people hanging out around the station, but the hotel is away from that business. Just be aware of surroundings and belongings as one around any train stations and when in major cities and I think it\u2019s fine. The hotel is about a 20 walk to the famous Galeries Lafayette shopping center which has a free rooftop view, as well as a restaurant up there (check the hours for the rooftop because may close earlier than the shopping center).\n\nThe staff was friendly and we particularly loved talking with warm and friendly Jessica who was working at the front desk when we checked in. Jessica provided excellent customer service and also spoke 4 languages.\n\nWe paid on Expedia about $471 total for 2 nights (breakdown below) which is an excellent price for a beautiful suite. Without the taxes and fees, it was about $204.49 a night. Paris hotels can easily be $500 a night for less space for a family of 4, so I thought this was excellent.\n\nAccommodation 1\n$449.87\nNights: 2 (avg./night)\n$204.49\nTaxes & fees\n$40.89\n\nOneKeyCash used\n-$17.22\nSubtotal\n$471.95\nCollected by Expedia\n\nLocally collected mandatory fees/taxes*\n$39.30\nTotal\n$471.95", "time": 1753178551, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "M Farhan", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114495645445558946786/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI4XZn4ORGh25QCy-TH0-VEkkbRUo4civ_ykvpdQ9ztILPLkA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "I recently stayed at Hotel Le Rocroy and had a very pleasant experience from start to finish. The hotel\u2019s location is excellent \u2014 just a short walk from Gare du Nord station \u2014 making it extremely convenient for travelers arriving by train or wanting to explore different parts of Paris easily. Whether heading to Montmartre, central Paris, or catching an early train, the location really can\u2019t be beat.\n\nThe hotel itself is clean, modern, and well-kept. What stood out the most was the hospitality of the staff. They were welcoming, polite, and always ready to assist with directions, restaurant recommendations, or any questions I had during my stay. Their friendly attitude made the atmosphere feel warm and lively, which really added to the experience.\n\nOne minor issue was that the Airbnb listing I booked through did not mention whether Wi-Fi was available, which was initially concerning. Thankfully, Wi-Fi was available throughout the hotel and worked reliably during my stay.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Hotel Le Rocroy to anyone looking for a centrally located, comfortable, and well-managed place to stay in Paris.
