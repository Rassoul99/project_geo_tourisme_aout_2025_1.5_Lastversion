The interior is dark, heavy, and has not aged well \u2013 it truly looks and feels like it\u2019s stuck in the 1970s. The dark red carpets and furnishings give a worn, almost dirty impression. It\u2019s not just about aesthetics \u2013 there\u2019s a general feeling of neglect.\n\nMy room (420) was of a decent size, which is a plus for Paris, but cleanliness left much to be desired. I found garbage from previous guests upon check-in, which is unacceptable. The minibar prices were also shockingly inflated \u2013 \u20ac8 for a small Toblerone, which you can find just a minute away at Carrefour for around \u20ac1.30.\n\nBreakfast was by far the worst part of the stay. I gave it a try on the first morning and never returned. There were very few options, poor quality food, and no available tables. The atmosphere was uncomfortable, and the staff appeared uninterested and disengaged.\n\nOn a slightly better note, the ladies at the reception were polite and did their job adequately, but the internet connection was unreliable, which added to the overall frustration.\n\nThis hotel might have once been something special, but now it relies solely on its location and charges premium prices for subpar service and outdated facilities.

The Warwick Hotel Champs Elysees is at the Top of the List for Phenomenol Service. When we walked in, we were met by a sweet kind caring woman who sat us in the lobby and graciously brought over 2 glasses of water with lemon wedges, smiled and treated us like guests in her home. Her energy was sweet and caring and we were surprised by how welcoming she was. The AMAZING part was\u2026 she was the Director of the entire hotel, the leader who leads by example and sets the tone and mood of the entire property. We stay at the finest hotels in the world and have never been met and cared for by the Director of any hotel in 40 years. Yes, Annabelle, the Warwick Director is the only Professional leader in the hospitality business to show such Grace, Respect and kindness. She was at the front desk, walking the hotel checking on guests and helping fellow employees. She inspires her staff, respects her staff and most importantly \u2026 interacts with guest when most directors hide in their offices like they are above others and too important to actually work. Her staff like, respect and adore their Leader and mirror her kindness and Professionalism. Everyone at the front desk, bell desk, security, bars, restaurants, housekeeping and room service were beyond beyond sweet. Brennen, in guest relations called us several times asking if we needed anything, Franklin in room service, greeted us with a huge smile, set up our breakfast and poured our coffee and said \u201c anything you need please call and I\u2019ll be here in just moments\u201d. He even took some boxes and bags from the room after our shopping\u2026we we so impressed by his sweet nature\u2026 we tipped him 50\u20ac on a 50\u20ac breakfast bill. We love Annabelle, Franklin, Brennen and the whole staff. Thank you Annabelle, for making our trip unbelievable, for treating us like Royalty and uplifting our trip, you should teach Directors around the world how to lead, how to show kindness and grace\u2026 you\u2019re a STAR and Warwick Hotels and Resorts are Blessed to have you and you\u2019re  Blessed because Warwick Hotels is a Phenomenal Hotel Group who cares about their staff and customers. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude07", "time": 1746605989, "translated": false}], "types": ["establishment", "food", "lodging", "point_of_interest", "restaurant"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=15935741411480836939", "user_ratings_total": 1368, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "5 Rue de Berri, Paris", "website": "https://www.warwickhotels.com/warwick-paris/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=local&utm_campaign=seo", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}
