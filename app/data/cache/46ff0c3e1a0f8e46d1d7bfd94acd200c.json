We were offered a complimentary breakfast to compensate. We spent a horrible night with a small fan to give us air.\nThe next day they gave us our new room. Ac was working but the bathroom sink was clogged. We called to have them look at it and found that it was unclogged but still not draining properly. We found the toilet dirty and called maintenance to come back. He said that is the best he could do for the sink and upon unclogging, the toilet was backed up. He would send someone to come clean. No one from housekeeping ever came.\nWe went out for the evening and coming back, as my husband was brushing his teeth, the nastiness came back up in the sink. The handicap rooms are clearly not maintained or cleaned properly. There is mildew and crud in corners and there is a constant smell. The floors have marks from water damage.\nThis is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. We  chose Marriott, an American chain for its standards which have clearly not been respected.
