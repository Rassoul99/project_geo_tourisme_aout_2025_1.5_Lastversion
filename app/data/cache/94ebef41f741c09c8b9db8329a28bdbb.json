Each day, we also used the valet service, which is managed by the concierge department, as you know. When handing over the car, the hotel provides a report to the room, checking if there are any scratches, damages, or dents on the vehicle, and records it. All reports showed no issues.\n\nHowever, when I received the car back on Wednesday, August 27th, the right front and right rear sides of the car were very clearly scratched. I immediately informed the concierge manager about this situation.\n\nAt first, he claimed it was not their responsibility and that the car had already been in that condition. But once I showed him the official car report sent to my room, it became clear that the damage had happened while in their care.\n\nThe concierge manager took my phone number and assured me that he would investigate the matter and get back to me. But, as you might guess, nobody ever followed up with me. I am a businessman, so I don\u2019t chase after such matters which is why I didn\u2019t go back again to remind them that they never returned to me.\n\nBecause in a well-managed hotel, the concierge department would certainly update the guest regarding such an important matter.\nInstead, nobody said anything, and I assume they expected me to forget about it.\n\nThis is not about the money\u2014it is insignificant to me. i paid 7.000 euro this hotel for 4 days.\nThe real issue is that a hotel of this standard could treat its guest in such a manner, showing no regard and failing to provide any feedback.\n\nI found this very disappointing and unworthy of such an establishment", "time": 1756587485, "translated": false}], "types": ["establishment", "lodging", "point_of_interest"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=325567977249353272", "user_ratings_total": 2684, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Piazza della Repubblica, 17, Milano", "website": "https://www.dorchestercollection.com/milan/hotel-principe-di-savoia", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}
