As a Marriott gold member ( my husband and the reservation was under his name), I had anticipated a high standard of service and cleanliness, but I encountered numerous issues that significantly affected my stay.\nFirstly, the cleanliness of the room was subpar. I found several areas that had clearly been overlooked by housekeeping, which was very disappointing. After contacting the front desk to voice my concerns, I did notice an improvement in cleaning on the day following my call. However, the subsequent days returned to the same poor standards, which was frustrating and unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber.\nThe breakfast experience was equally disappointing. When I decided to dine in the breakfast area, I encountered a long wait. The hostess was engrossed in conversation and failed to acknowledge my presence for over 15 minutes. I ultimately had to call her by name just to get seated. To add to my discontent, the table I was given was dirty, with breadcrumbs left from previous guests. I had to request that it be cleaned, which should never be necessary in a top-tier hotel.\nAdditionally, my attempts to have my luggage collected were met with frustration. I called multiple times for assistance, but no one responded. This lack of attention to guests\u2019 needs is simply unacceptable for a five-star hotel.\nOverall, the service throughout my stay was below average, and it\u2019s clear that there is a significant gap between the hotel\u2019s pricing and the quality of service provided. I was genuinely expecting a more luxurious experience based on the hotel\u2019s branding, but I was left disappointed.\nGiven these experiences, I regret to say that I will not be returning to The Westin Palace Hotel in the future. The high prices should correspond with a higher standard of service and cleanliness. I sincerely hope that the management takes serious steps to address these issues for the sake of future guests.", "time": 1754342341, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Jamie Mansfield", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114208203767986150800/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXwgLSN_krh4Hrzhy_6xz0swWkTUCEh5nDCkGEHNfccXMphXG4naA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "Review: The Westin Palace Milan\nA disappointing stay.
