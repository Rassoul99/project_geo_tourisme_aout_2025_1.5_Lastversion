Honestly I had high expectations due to the very steep nightly cost and generally glowing reviews.  It is located right on the Champs Elysees next to Sephora.  There was always an attentive doorman.  We are a well traveled family of four, two boys 9 & 11 from the States, stayed for 3 nights the end of August.  They brought us all a welcome drink at check in and some candies which was nice.  The \"family room\" we booked was two double beds, the room itself a decent size for Europe.  Beds were just ok comfort wise, not great.  All the family rooms, look out over the lobby.  No outside windows and this felt very claustrophobic and dark.  At check in they told us the mini bar would be refilled daily but never was the whole stay.  We are Titanium with Marriott and the breakfast was included, otherwise 50 EUR a person.  Buffet style, it was OK.  Pastries were great and everything else was underwhelming.  They are doing renovations which are slightly disruptive and the outside windows were covered in scaffolding, but generally seem to be frosted on the regular (in the breakfast area).  Unless you are coming just for shopping on the Champs Elysees or visiting the Arc de Triomphe we ubered a LOT.  To be fair, Paris is a huge city but this is not close to the major sites (Eiffel tower or the Louvre, Notre Dame).  We had one rainy day and did appreciate the ample amount of umbrellas the doormen had - though we had our own. OH, and a big annoyance was every single morning the cleaning staff would knock and then open the door straight away.  We did not have the DND sign on but I expect the briefest moment to respond to a knock.  Not given.  Also perhaps a rowdy night, I don't know, but the one evening the lobby ladies room was filthy.  One last thing, the floor of the main level lobby was super slippery on the rain day and I slipped on the wet coming in, jamming my finger in the process.  I'm really not a person to complain, I just had higher expectations for what is billed as a luxury hotel and definitely an extremely high cost.  I wouldn't stay here again, due to the claustrophobic rooms and location.", "time": 1756866762, "translated": false}], "types": ["establishment", "lodging", "point_of_interest"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=15641137556210518696", "user_ratings_total": 1935, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "70 Av. des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Paris", "website": "https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/pardt-paris-marriott-champs-elysees-hotel/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}
