This hotel is made into a world class stay due to its incredible staff, notably the two incredible young women stewarding the front desk, Miss Maria and Miss Betty. My cousin and I had an impromptu trip into Paris and were lucky enough to snag a room at Hotel Pulitzer. Greeting us was Miss Betty. She was full of knowledge about the city; where to eat, the best parks to relax, and where to go for dinner. She was thoughtful and very patient with us as my French is rugged at best! Then we met Miss Maria later on and WOW these two women were the best team! Maria herself taught us how to use the metro system, guided us on a map where best to sight see, gave even more restaurant and park recommendations, and in general was just so warmhearted! While the hotel itself is beautiful in its own right, with clean rooms and excellent breakfasts, these two women represented the company with grace and utmost professionalism. These women made our stay so impressive in fact, that I came back only a month later with my parents, specifically to Hotel Pulitzer, for our extended trip.
