We came to this restaurant mid August and can only assume that the Chef was away for his summer vacation. It was without a doubt the worst food we have ever eaten. Usually we were just pay and go however it was so unacceptable and so revolting that we just had to say something. Having been seduced by the rather pretty photos and website as well as the reviews we were very excited however upon entering the rather grubby courtyard we were disappointed by a very underwhelming exterior dining area. It feels rather like a catfish \u2013 the reality does not match the rather bucolic scene that they portray. We were also bombarded by music being played from a dance studio overlooking the courtyard all evening drowning out any kind of ambience. This is however the least of our concerns. When finally a waiter came to our table they told us approximately 50% of the menu was sold out and we were left with a few slim pickings from a very reduced and small menu anyway. We were also told that the only ros\u00e9 that was available was a Magnum and they had no ros\u00e9 available by the bottle which seems rather strange in France.We wondered whether to get up and leave at that point as we were already so unimpressed by it and there was nothing left on the menu we particularly wanted to order however seeing as it was already close to 9 pm, we decided to stick with it and make the best of it, however, that was impossible. My husband ordered the bouillabaisse which comes in two parts. Two separate servings. Both were ice cold and tasted absolutely revolting. I actually urged him not to continue eating it because it really didn\u2019t taste correct. We\u2019ve eaten many bouillabaisse In the south of France and it\u2019s one of my husband\u2019s favourite things, but this was literally revolting. I ordered the confit of Lamb that was stuffed in various different very badly prepared vegetables. Again, the confit was lukewarm bordering cold, Looked horrific and tasted like something that would be served on an aeroplane at best. It definitely had the feeling that it been microwaved and reheated but not very well. Let me be clear \u2013 my husband literally eats ANYTHING and devours everything that is served to him on an aeroplane however he left almost all of his food which is unheard of. I took one bite of my main course and immediately left it. My daughter and her friend also left their food. Ordinarily, we would chalk it up to bad luck and move on, but this was so far beyond that. We did let them know that this was inedible but were told that \u201cFrench people enjoy this\u201d. I can only imagine that The actual chef was away on vacation. We have just spent the last few hours googling the Chef incredulous as to why we had the experience we had this evening and cannot fathom any other reason. We did manage to have all the main courses removed from our final bill, but we were very happy to pay for the drinks that we received and the wine.  We were surprised to find that they had also charged us for the starters. I would\u2019ve thought they would\u2019ve removed that from the bill. This horrific experience cost us \u20ac188 for what was a couple of drinks and some very poor appetisers for my daughter, a wasted evening and we left hungry having to pick up a cr\u00eape on the side of the road on the way back to our hotel. We shall be making our hotel aware not to be sending any more of their clients there in future. Without a doubt the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had in a restaurant!

The service was exceptional! Props to the lady assisting us for our needs. With regards to food, overall everything was tasty but in my view some details I would like to see took away the 5/5 rating like the crispy skin on the fish. Description of the dishes was quite complicated but in my view they were quite simplistic. I found quite odd the approach of serving 1/4 of a chicken breast for a main course.
