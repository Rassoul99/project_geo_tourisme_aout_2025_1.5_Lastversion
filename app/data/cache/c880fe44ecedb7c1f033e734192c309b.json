Much time had passed however since I had visited Europe and stayed in a first rate hostel. So, in late autumn of 2024 I took the opportunity to visit France for the first time and stayed in the Casa Champgil for several weeks while carrying out a project. I'd originally intended to stay just a few days but I found the conditions so amenable to work and rest that I extended repeatedly and returned here after other journeys in the region. Anthony, the host is incredibly warm and gracious and I greatly enjoyed the many conversations I shared with him and the other travelers I met in the hostel over the several weeks. The vibe is super chill and I would recommend Casa Champgil to anyone visiting the city whether for a short visit or longer term, whether for work or to explore the city. Everything is brand new and extremely clean -- well the building actually dates I believe to the 1700s, but a good balance has been struck between retaining the best features of the older architecture with modern renovation and tasteful design undertaken in raw materials, everything in stone, wood, glass and steel with a natural and spare aesthetic. I particularly loved their decision to expose the original volcanic stone in the walls of the stairwell. The common area downstairs has numerous tables inside and in the courtyard and I enjoyed spending time there both socialising and getting work done in late hours, the beds are comfortable and I slept quite well most nights as travelers were generally thoughtful and quiet. I found the breakfast offered to be quite convenient and certainly worth paying for on a busy schedule, since Anthony kindly had the feast ready when I emerged from my quarters each morning, and introduced me to several of the local types of cheese and baguette as well as delicious croissants and other pastries. Importantly, the coffee was seriously excellent and I appreciated that Anthony took the trouble to make extra upon request! One other thing to note is that the hostel is a short walk from some great restaurants and cafes, as well as the Gaillard light rail stop which makes it very easy to reach other parts of town, including the Pardieu station at the terminus if you want to head elsewhere at some point. I am so grateful to Anthony and Casa Champgil for helping to making my stay in town pleasant and productive. I will certainly come back and stay at Casa Champgil, as my experience staying there has renewed my old faith in hostels and left me with a very high opinion of France and the French people.", "time": 1735952848, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Didier Soulier", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109167552850606421631/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV0tJfSX8S18LNDfWsswkIHnXtmB-goG4SZRZD_I5m_3HMWvbkt=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "A little heaven to create great memories.
