I would like to extend my gratitude to Francesca for her warm welcome and for providing detailed information about the hotel and city transportation. I hope she encounters similarly courteous individuals in the future. If the hotel does not impose a price on you, you are free to select it. I would recommend it.

Each of them had great suggestions as to how to get somewhere, where we should eat, what to go see, and each must be commended for being such good listeners and interpreters. My French is not as good as I should have liked it to be.\n\nOur room on the sixth floor overlooked the back of the Louvre and the Saint-\nGermain-l'Auxerrois church. By the way, the church should not be missed. It is magnificent. The bed was so comfortable, the decor was perfect. And that view! Another good indicator that the hotel and the staff were doing a superb job was the number of people we saw in the lobby who were obviously repeat visitors.\n\nWe've already had two friends who either have booked or plan to book rooms at this perfect boutique hotel. If you are looking for a place to stay during your first trip to Paris or your repeat trip, please try Le Relais Du Louvre.

Wow I knew this hotel would deliver but they over delivered. I can't say enough good things about the staff at this hotel. From booking reservation and car services to making restaurant recommendations and keeping our rooms looking immaculate, they were everything we could ask for and more. The location of this hotel is perfect. Although we decided to skip using the metro and opted for Ubers, there is a metro right down the block. Tons of restaurants within walking distance, close to the Louvre and within walking distance of so many other sites. The rooms were quaint, clean and COOL!! Staying during a hot week in June, we were so thankful to come back to ac cooled rooms. Highly recommend the breakfast tray, it's worth it and 1 tray can feed 1-3 people easily depending on how hungry you are. We had to move rooms during our stay bc the room we wanted wasn't available for our entire visit. The staff helped us with this transition making it super easy. Room #02 has the most adorable little patio access. Room #65 has windows that open facing the church next door. Wonderful to hear the bells ringing in the morning. Room 51 is a family room, spacious for a family of 4. The attention to detail from this hotel is wonderful, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Paris. This is a hidden gem!!!!\n\nI am unable to review in person details about this hotel yet as our stay isn't happening until summer 2025. I can however already review the phenomenal level of service from this hotel. We have had a complicated reservation dilemma and the hotel staff has been absolutely wonderful. They have been in constant communication with me through the process. To say we are looking forward to our stay is an understatement. I will be sure to update this review after our stay and I have no doubt my rating will remain a 5 star.

Location is the biggest asset, but hotel has a small reception area, and rather cold staff. It can do with some more energy, the reception should feel comfortable, perhaps couches don't overlook the staff desk making guests feel as if they are at an interview. The coffee machine in the reception and water jug looked uninviting, and we never saw anyone use them. Nor did anyone offer. Overall the feeling is not of warmth.\nOur room had no natural light and was small, and oddly structured. Bathroom steamed and the shower was handheld, and moved. The shampoo dispenser was hard to use, and we had to ask if we could use an unlabeled bottle of liquid. The rooms do get outside noise as the building is old.
