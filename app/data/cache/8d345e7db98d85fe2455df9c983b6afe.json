We stayed 3 nights after travelling into Paris on the Eurostar. The hotel is located a mere 10 minute walk from the eurostar station so was perfectly located. The staff were impeccable! Yassir in the daytime (handsome young guy with curls and spectacles) was so friendly, happy, helpful and just adorable. He is perfect for front of house! The night staff gentleman, Diddy, was also very lovely and friendly, as was the girl in the daytime with 2 pieces of hair loose at the front of her face, wonderful staff and fluent in english. We had a small problem with an overflow of water from the shower plug and this was sorted out in good time whilst we were out enjoying Paris. There was breakfast available from something like 7am until 10am if you wanted to add-on which was a simple process (i think it was \u20ac12.) There was also hot chocolate, hot drinks, sweets, mini pastries (croissants and pain au chocolat) available free of charge, as well as an ice box and a cold fresh water tap. All free in the reception area and a very nice touch!\nThe hotel is in the hub of a busy and lively location in Paris; restaurants, cafes and shops line the adjacent streets and there is plently to do and see. The metro stations were dotted around very close by, as well as a lovely little indoor market across the street from the hotel which sold fruits, meat, wines, bakery etc. The hotel itself was no frills but perfect for our needs and bigger than expected. We had 3 twin beds (2 pushed together) power outlets dotted around, an opening window with a view of the ground floor terrace (where guests could socialise etc) a small shower room that was a little cramped but definitely fit-for-purpose with shampoo, conditioner, towels and hairdryer. The room had a working tv, kettle, tea and coffee condiments. What more can I say?! Great little hotel with comfortable beds to rest and refresh yourself when exploring this fantastic city. I would recommend and visit this hotel again!
