Another drink in a baby bottle is served with this.\nThere were three options for desert which also came with a shot, I think if some cherry liquor.\nTo be honest I would expect to get a little more variety than just bread for dipping in  the fondue.

I learned about Le Refuge des Fondus from an online travel blog and thought it would be a fun place to visit after an evening Sacre Couer visit. My wife and I arrived to the restaurant just as they were closing to prepare for the 2nd dinner service. The hostess told us we should come back when they re-opened and that she would find us a table if the place wasn\u2019t booked solid with reservations. I can\u2019t believe I forgot to make a reservation! Smh. Fortunately, 15 min after the restaurant reopened and the hostess seated everyone who had reservations, there was still a table for my wife and me. Two other pairs with no reservations also made it in.\nMy wife and I ordered the cheese fondue option. It was a lot of bread and a lot of cheese! We had it after kir, an appetizer, and a few swigs of wine/beer from a baby bottle. The baby bottles got lots of laughs. Quite the experience. After dinner, we had dessert and another kir, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\nI\u2019m so glad my wife and I ate here.
