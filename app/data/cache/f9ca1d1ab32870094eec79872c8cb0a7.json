Very convenient locations with many metro lines right outside of the hotel and plenty of shops and restaurants in the area.\n\nThe room was ok. Very old fashioned. The bathroom was clean on the surface but the toilet was stained. Toilet paper was the cheapest roughest kind and we had to buy our own. The toiletries provided were tiny so we were lucky we brough out own. There was an issue with our mini bar and the AC. The mini bar was leaking water on the inside and soaked all our food we put in there. Once reported, we were told it got cleaned but didn't seem to make any difference. After second mention, the issue got sorted on the second day. The AC wouldn't go below 24\u00b0C which was still a bit too hot for us and kept switching itself off. Had to get up 2-3 times during the night to turn in back on. After many back and forth the switching off issue got sorted for the last night but it still wouldn't go lower than 24\u00b0C.\n\nWe used the hotel breakfast once. Non offensive continental buffet. Nothing extra with not many options for cheeses/meats. At check out, were were informed the one breakfast we had was complimentary. Whether this is the standard or to compensate for the room issues, I don't know. But it was greatly appreciated.\n\nThe staff were all very friendly and lovely. And they seemed to genuinely try and help with the AC thing.\n\nOverall, we were satisfied with our stay but would probably go for a bit more modern hotel in the same area if we were to return to Paris.", "time": 1756790965, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Nisha T", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102335051455608010125/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL4knPCB2q3N9VykQ_uCVyOqvc_EhbEzFylJDUy8VuNLDm-5A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Very impressed by this hotel and the staff.
