Ranging from quality of service, rooms to overall experience. The manager, Amy is beyond rude and should not be the manager. Upon arrival the phone in my room was not working and they sent a technician to fix but wasn\u2019t able to. I had to use my personal cell phone to call the front desk multiple times!! Rooms don\u2019t come with water. Rooms are disgusting, damp and very dated. The lights in my bathroom were not working/ needed bulb replacement and the bedding was polyester making night sweats eminent.  Very uncomfortable bed and noisy hallways.  One early morning at 7am, the hallway alarm went off for 20 mins and the manager said it was a safety alarm and brushed it off.  Four days into my stay, the AC was not working and my room was half cleaned with the comforter missing. After complaining to Alessia (front desk manager), she offered a refund of my last day or to remain with my prepaid reservation with a 50% for the last day of my stay. I decided to take the refund. By the time I searched for a new hotel most places were sold out or very expensive so I had to stay the last prepaid evening at this horrible place. When informing Amy, she said all refunds and discounts were only good at the time they were offered. She was super rude about it and said she already sold my room and for the inconvenience I could stay at full price.  Yes. That was her professional handling of this matter.  When agreeing to stay she assured me that room service would not disturb me and would notify her staff immediately with an email. An hour after she assured me, the cleaning staff banged on my door even though there was a \u2018do not disturb\u2019 tag on my door. When responding to the cleaning staff they told me they were never informed. The manager was nowhere to be found.  Room 2302 has a nice view of the Seine but you are right next to the elevator and it\u2019s pretty noisy. AC is quite damp and doesn\u2019t give off cold air.  Rooms are dank and dark. The management is incompetent and honestly, you are in the heart of American Touristville - there are far better places than this very outdated nightmare of a hotel. THIS HOTEL IS NO WHERE NEAR BEING A 4-STAR.

As a result, they had to give us two separate individual rooms. They didn\u2019t care that we were a group or that there were minors with us \u2014 we had to split up.\n\nThe next morning, they told us that if we vacated the rooms before 10 a.m., they could give us the two apartment rooms we had originally booked. Because of this, we had to pack up in a rush, as we were not expecting to make such a change so early. Additionally, the guide we had hired had to wait for us to finish moving all our luggage, since no one at the hotel offered any help.\n\nAs for the breakfast, it leaves much to be desired. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable that, five years after COVID, they still don\u2019t clean the rooms. A hotel that claims to be four stars should offer daily cleaning. They are clearly taking advantage of the post-COVID situation and never rehired staff.\n\nGuests have to go down to the basement to pick up towels, which is very unpleasant. Moreover, the room cleaning and the changing of sheets is never done.\n\nRegarding the front desk staff, unfortunately, their service also left us with a bad experience.\n\nThe only thing I can say positively about this hotel is the location. Everything else \u2014 the carpets are dirty, the bathrooms are in poor condition, the curtains are very old and worn out. The overall quality is outdated, the toilet flush doesn\u2019t work properly, and the bathroom layout is very uncomfortable.", "time": 1753863184, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Milagros Maria Victory", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102553618859072642577/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK2CYnHkk3kx9qhrpWn1M24Ev7XzM7no2tbYO-17iVmyTGhhw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "A total disappointment. I do not recommend it.\n\nWe stayed at this hotel, which advertises itself as a 4-star property, but the experience fell far below even the minimum expectations. We arrived at 10 p.m. to find that the rooms we had reserved were not available, and we were given worse ones instead. The next day, we had to move again to finally get the correct rooms. In total, we were forced to switch rooms multiple times.\n\nThe overall state of the hotel leaves much to be desired: everything is quite dirty, from the lobby to the breakfast area and the bathrooms in the rooms. Housekeeping does not clean the rooms during your stay. The breakfast is very basic and far from the standard expected of a hotel in this category.\n\nAdditionally, the bathroom sink was broken, which caused water to remain stagnant for over 24 hours. We reported it several times, but no one came to fix it. The only \u201ccompensation\u201d they offered was a piece of chocolate.\n\nBut the worst part was the attitude of the staff. We lost a personal item (a pair of sandals) due to the constant room changes, and the only response we received was: \u201csorry.\u201d They never offered a solution or even showed any interest in helping. We felt ignored and mistreated\u2014whether due to xenophobia or sheer incompetence is unclear. One of the front desk staff members, whose name I believe is Dnysse (though I\u2019m not even sure because she initially refused to give it to me), lied to us by claiming she didn\u2019t speak Spanish and showed absolutely no willingness to help.\n\nThe only redeeming quality is the location, which is excellent.\nWe paid 4-star prices, but the experience didn\u2019t even reach the level of a 1-star hotel.\n\nUPDATE AFTER MANAGEMENT REPLY\n\nThank you for your reply, but unfortunately it only confirms my experience: a lot of polite wording, but no real accountability.\n\nYou mention that the studio rooms were an \u201cupgrade\u201d \u2014 but two separate studios are not an upgrade from an apartment when you\u2019re traveling with kids. It\u2019s simply not a logical or practical alternative. It was not a favor, it was a downgrade disguised as a solution.\n\nIn fact, if the studios were truly an upgrade, then why were we later moved to an apartment \u2014 free of charge \u2014 as a gesture of goodwill? That clearly contradicts your claim. If the apartment was inferior, you would\u2019ve charged us for \u201cdowngrading.\u201d But you didn\u2019t. Because it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAs for the sink, again: saying no one was in the room is not an excuse. You managed to fix it the next day while we were out, which proves you could\u2019ve done it earlier if you had prioritized it.\n\nRegarding the sandals, a \u201cthorough check\u201d from your team should have happened immediately after we reported the loss, not days later. By then, of course nothing would be found.\n\nAnd finally, you admit that several team members speak Spanish \u2014 which makes it even more unacceptable that one of them deliberately lied to my mother saying she didn\u2019t. That is not a communication issue, it is a matter of basic honesty and respect.\n\nI appreciate the effort to sound attentive, but this response does not change the fact that what we lived was far from a 4-star experience, and excuses will not fix that.", "time": 1753962657, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Hewitt Family Travels", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111049557482097842895/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJcJSEjUVLe_UI6s2dhO1iKM-GB3VXUgqo-mQAxbmLw8D9rDg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "We stayed one night.
