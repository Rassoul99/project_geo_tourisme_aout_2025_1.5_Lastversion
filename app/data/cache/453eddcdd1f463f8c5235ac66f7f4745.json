We learned this after arriving at the OBW from the airport.  Hotel Riquet - Wi-Fi doesn't work on either my or my wife's iPhone.  Never experienced this before, in any other hotel.  I was able to connect with my laptop.  Room was stuffy, but we could not use the air conditioning, which is controlled by management, because the temperature outside isn\u2019t \"warm enough\".  Our stay was in late May.  Leaving the windows open after dusk was a no-go due to an influx of mosquitoes.  D\u00e9cor is rough at best.  There is mold in parts of the bathroom.  If we hadn\u2019t already unpacked, I would have asked for a new room.  However, its not good in any event.  Proper ventilation would help.  Also, the room phone didn't work.  Never stayed in a hotel with no ability to phone the front desk before.  On the positive side, the staff is very friendly and multi-lingual.  Also, the Riquet is very close to the train station (less than ten minutes walking), which was important for us.
