The hotel's rules regarding noise were clear and respected, ensuring a peaceful atmosphere. The location couldn't be better\u2014just a short walk from iconic landmarks, metro stations, and fantastic dining options.\n\nAs a first-time visitor to Paris, staying here truly enhanced our experience. On our checkout, Amina went above and beyond by helping us call a cab to the airport, which was so appreciated.

Ground floor room. Appears to be a converted hotel office. Every night I heard the receptionists eating and watching their tablets (no earbuds, could hear the dialogue) and talking with late arrivals. Three nights, three receptionists. Saturday night 11pm the dance music started next door. Could hear not just the thumping, but also the lyrics.\n\nThe wifi is underpowered. Could not use Spotify for my kids, apps I tried to open that use connectivity would hang indefinitely. Mobile data availability (O2, UK partners) was so-so.\n\nThe room came with 2 single beds and 1 double bed. Smallest double bed I've come across, not workable. Small double?\n\nBathroom, the toilet is weird. Truly do not want to go into too much detail, but they need to match the seat with the toilet. It appears that any ol' seat will do for them.\n\nExcellent location. If I was traveling alone or with friends I wouldn't care at all about the stuff I've been complaining about above.
