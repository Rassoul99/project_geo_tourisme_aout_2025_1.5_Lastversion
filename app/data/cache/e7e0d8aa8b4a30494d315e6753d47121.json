The morning after I arrived (Tuesday/Wednesday), not a single extra bed was free, which is an uncomfortable thought if one takes issue with their room in particular.\n\nThere is one ladder shared by two sets of bunk beds and requires some dexterity as it is anchored at a 90 degree angle to the beds itself. The top bunks are open to the ceiling, which, if you're light sensitive without an eye mask, means every flick of the light becomes a problem. I woke up instantly when the first guest left in the morning, after specifically searching for a hostel with a capsule/pod-like bed to avoid this.\n\nThe size of the room itself becomes an issue when the underbed storage isn't accessible because the caged lid won't open until it's fully withdrawn. The entire walkway becomes occluded, also meaning the front door won't open if someone has their drawer open. The likelihood of this becoming an issue at certain times of the day is highly probable.\n\nThere's a sink and mirror in the room, but given the lack of respect I experienced from other guests in the space, I imagine this could become a source of contention for some. I did notice the bathrooms were filthy on my floor and there was a stark lack of check marks after 11:00, indicating an employee had come around to clean things. I used the facilities as late as 23:00 and noticed the next morning that someone had added extra check marks where there were none. There had been a sink full of crud all day, where it seemed someone washed mud caked socks, and another sink had a contact lens in it that would rehydrate anytime someone used the sink. It's nice that the showers have a locking door and places to put toiletries, but they share a divider with a toilet stall and the motion lights go out on you while showering and the water button must be pressed every 15 or 20 seconds.\n\nI found the place entirely lacking in common areas that aren't an obnoxious bar. The location is prime for other nightlife, but for folks hoping for some quiet solitude to work on their laptops, this place is not it.\n\nYou have to buy locks and towels (no deposit system).\n\nThis would be my last resort hostel every time. While it can be fairly cheap (~40\u20ac), it still feels like quite a rip off, given how lovely my stay was at hostels in Belgium and Berlin.
