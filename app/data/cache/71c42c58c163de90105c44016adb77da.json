Most of the dishes were seafood based which I liked, and some of the dishes were surprising as I have never tried the combination of ingredients before. It was quite refreshing and unique to me that these combination could complement so well and great job to the chef.\nA truly good meal and nothing to fault about, its 1 star Michelin and yet it doesn't burn a hole in the pocket.\nBefore I left at the door I actually met the chef and got a handshake.
