So, he just began screaming that I was disturbing him, when I was only asking for help in a 100% subtle way. He kept with the key but didn\u2019t register anything.\n\nREPLY 1 - 16/06: I didn't treat anyone badly and I didn't raise my voice as you have replied. At the time as I arrived, he was asking the whole time for a paper, not a badge, and it's not my fault that the owner of the apartment did not prepare it. I only had to leave the key there as I took the same key one day before, according to the instructions I had. He refused to let me take the picture OF THE KEY and began screaming, as if i didn't do it, i would pay a 50$ fee for the apartment's owner.
