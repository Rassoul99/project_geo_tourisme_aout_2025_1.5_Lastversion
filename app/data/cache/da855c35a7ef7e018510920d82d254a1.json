It\u2019s part of Alain Ducasse\u2019s group now, so you know you\u2019re in good hands food-wise.\n\nI went for the set lunch menu (please take note that set menu may be changed from time to time), it was beautifully prepared, simple yet traditional French dishes done right. The flavors were rich but balanced, and the portions were just right, not too heavy.\n\nThe service was amazing, very attentive without being overbearing. I was looked after by a friendly lady who made me feel welcome from the moment I walked in. She explained the menu really well and checked in just the right amount. It\u2019s those little touches that make a meal feel just nice.\n\nAt the end of the meal, they brought out some chocolate from their own factory, which was such a nice surprise. Rich, smooth, and just the perfect finish to a really satisfying lunch.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Paris and want a relaxed but good French dining experience without the tourist-trap vibe, Benoit is a solid choice. It feels like stepping into a piece of history, but with warm service and food that totally holds up today.\n\nRecommend for lunch, definitely worth a visit.", "time": 1750737030, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Rishabh Malhotra", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116629505952996639656/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUWXz8Fv1sdYIqjTkL1J78ITn_l9One-cxN2ymzrUVjkQYrNJZOYQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "I had a really nice experience at Benoit.

The menu was solid and well balanced. The portions were also better than I expected. We came in a group of 5, so we had the chance to try most of the menu, and all of it was good. Even the cheese puffs we got at the beginning were yummy. The restaurant itself is beautiful, and the staff were friendly and welcoming. It was great how the staff took time to explain not just the menu, but also the history behind the restaurant. As a tourist visiting Paris, that was definitely a plus.\n\nOur reservation was at 7pm, which is when the restaurant opened. My only small complaint (Though I may be nitpicking here) is that they seated us at the very end of the restaurant, in a smaller corner. This could be because we\u2019re a bigger group, but considering we had an earlier reservation when the restaurant wasn\u2019t that full it would\u2019ve been nice to sit a bit closer out. But it\u2019s okay.\n\nMy favourites were the Cookpot spelt, escargot, and the steak. Special shout out to the seasonal tomato dish\u2014 not usually a tomato person but that was a really good starter. Would definitely come back!", "time": 1753218762, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Jean Philip De Tender", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101573954936475342758/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUhE5_Bx-2MIjBt_Jn15kFG4zQHhnSCys5FPE12Yo2BQo9v55bX=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "This is the second time we visited Benoit.\n\nAlthough the neighbourhood feels commercial, you enter a true French, Parisian institution.\n\nOwned by the Ducasse Group, they uphold Frenc traditions.\n\nWe had p\u00e2te en croute as a starter, then volaille fermi\u00e8re and cassoulet maison.\n\nThe cheese was 'affin\u00e9' and the strawberries delicious.\n\nThis restaurant is also appreciated by (wealthy) tourists but they handle them well here.", "time": 1753647366, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Joe Padilla", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109747625433939934752/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVb61HKiP757Ro9tS5BT8_VIf4bB3NOMAXKSur0gfMoB7dgou2D=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "I will first start off by saying that the service here was fantastic and the wait staff were super friendly and very attentive!\n\nI made reservations for the restaurant a couple weeks in advance, but when I came in at 7pm (opening time) I was seated right at the entranceway where patrons come in to check in for their reservations. I wondered if it was because I was a solo diner so it felt like I was an afterthought. So not only was it chilly whenever someone entered or exited the establishment, it felt awkward because my meal and dining experience was the first thing people saw when entering so it was a bit uncomfortable for me as I was getting some stares.\n\nMy food was actually just okay. I had the French onion soup which was good. I also had the beef ordered medium\u2014 however it came out (overcooked) medium well, and even though a sauce was poured onto it the meat still tasted bland and dry. For dessert I had little cream puffs that is dipped in a tasty chocolate sauce.\n\nI\u2019ve dined at many Michelin star restaurants across the USA, Portugal, and Spain and had wonderful, impressive experiences and meals at all of them. This experience was very much a let down. When dining at a Michelin restaurant, there was always that \u201cwow factor\u201d in the dishes and presentation, but that was not the case here. This experience felt like it was your average expensive restaurant. I would say that my favorite parts of the meal were the dessert as well as the bread (not the baguette\u2014 I felt like I almost chipped a tooth on how hard/stale it was).\n\nWould I come back? Most likely not. There are a ton more options across Paris that I would prefer to try over a repeat experience here.", "time": 1745439370, "translated": false}], "serves_beer": true, "serves_breakfast": false, "serves_brunch": false, "serves_dinner": true, "serves_lunch": true, "serves_vegetarian_food": false, "serves_wine": true, "takeout": false, "types": ["bar", "establishment", "food", "point_of_interest", "restaurant"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=14478655399410179573", "user_ratings_total": 2458, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "20 Rue Saint-Martin, Paris", "website": "https://www.benoit-paris.com/", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}
