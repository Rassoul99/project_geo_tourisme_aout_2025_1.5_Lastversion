There were no curtains around the beds, and the beds weren\u2019t even properly made. Instead of a duvet cover, they just gave two plain sheets like one for the mattress and one, I suppose, to cover yourself with? The mattress protector looked really dirty and clearly hadn\u2019t been changed.\nFrom the moment you walk in, you\u2019re bombarded with signs that say things like \u201cIf you break this, you\u2019ll pay X euros\u201d or \u201cdamage that, and it\u2019ll cost Y\u201d I mean, not exactly a warm welcome. And it made me so uncomfortable that I actually took photos of the broken things I found in the room like the bedside lamp, just in case they tried to charge me for it later.\nThe staff were far from friendly. There was barely any toilet paper in the bathrooms. The elevator felt very unsafe. The flush in my room didn\u2019t work properly. And the hairdryer barely blew any air and gave off a burnt smell, so I couldn\u2019t even use it I mean it was obviously broken.\nThe only good thing about this place is the location.
