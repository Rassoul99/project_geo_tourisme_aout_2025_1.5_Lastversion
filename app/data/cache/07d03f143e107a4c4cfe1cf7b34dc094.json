For entertainment the had cable tv and a iPad which we could order service and search the web. The downside being expensive. Since it was our anniversary they gave us complimentary champagne and macarons. Other things that were complimentary were soda water, water, and chocolate. Beds were comfy and high quality. Next was the breakfast. Breakfast was free being a mix of a buffet and a restaurant not much to say about the restaurant otherwise. The location is amazing right next to a river and the train station with many restaurants behind being a 7 minute walk. There were also many murals only a half an hour walk. Next is the spa the hotel has is NOT complimentary but the spa itself was amazing as well as there being a pool to relax in which you didn\u2019t have to pay for.
