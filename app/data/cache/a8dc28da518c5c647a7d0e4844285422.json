The facilities felt run-down and shabby, which took away from the overall experience. If the hotel ever updates its infrastructure, invest in working AC it could be a fantastic place to stay, thanks to the amazing personnel. T Alberto was by far the most professional hotel receptionist I\u2019ve ever encountered. He went above and beyond to help guests and truly deserves double the recognition (and pay!) for all his hard work trying to satisfy frustrated customers. Unfortunately, the hotel itself is in desperate need of improvement. There was no air conditioning until June 1st, the shower handle kept falling off, the tea kettle lid was broken, and the entire room was smelly and I felt like stepping back 100 years into a very old establishment.

Starting on a positive note, the staff were very accommodating \u2013 can\u2019t fault them on that, but there were some considerable negatives which made our stay very uncomfortable.\nOur attractive, well-styled room felt a bit cramped; my wife and I found ourselves constantly manoeuvring around each other, and even opening two suitcases at once was a challenge.\nLike others have said, our AC was almost completely ineffective, so much so that my wife asked reception to check that it was working at all. We were provided with a fan which initially seemed like a blessing, but it ended up not such a great solution after all (later). On leaving the room the power to devices was automatically turned off \u2013 I know this is common to reduce carbon emissions & cost, but this also shut down the ineffective AC so that on our return we were always met with a wall of heat and moisture which would take hours to reduce. The combination of claustrophobia and the heat/moisture made for an unpleasant stay.\nDuring our 2 days in Milan were eaten alive by mosquitoes (yes, we did use repellent sprays) but we were protected by clothing as well. At night though, my wife & I received multiple bites in areas that were protected during the day \u2013 our backs & shoulders etc. I strongly suspect that the \u201cinvaders\u201d were coming from the AC enclosure.\nI\u2019m no expert in either mosquitos or air conditioning, but I do know that poorly maintained AC systems can harbour mosquitoes when moisture gathers in drip trays etc. As you will see from the pictures the AC enclosure was badly warped indicating quite a lot of moisture.\nWhile the staff provided us with the portable fan (which was a help) it meant we had a choice \u2013 cover up from the fan & stay warm or uncover & wait for the biting. Neither of us got a decent sleep either way.\nAccess/egress for the shower.\nAnother serious annoyance for me was the positioning of the WC at the opening of the shower (pictured). I tripped over the WC twice on entering and once on the way out during our 2 day stay. I cannot believe this arrangement satisfies building regulations inside the EU. I can see this being a serious impediment to people with mobility issues or the elderly. I honestly believe that if I had stayed for a week or more, I would have \u201ctaken a dive\u201d at some point.\nThis hotel is rated as a 4 star, but we stayed in much more spacious and comfortable accommodation at Lake Garda and Venice & those were rated 3 stars.
