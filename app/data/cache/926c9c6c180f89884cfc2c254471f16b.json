While the variety wasn\u2019t extensive, it was more than enough to keep us happy and our tummies full. The pastries were particularly amazing!\n\nHowever, there were some less positive aspects related to the hotel\u2019s maintenance. The carpets and curtains in our room had noticeable stains, which was disappointing. Additionally, the shower head was broken, causing water to splash everywhere, and the shower door leaked all over the bathroom. We had to use all the towels to soak up the water, which meant we couldn\u2019t use them again the next day, as we try to limit towel usage to help the environment. Furthermore, the toilet seat and lid were both broken, and the air vents desperately needed to be cleaned. We reported these issues to the staff on our first day, but unfortunately, nothing was done during our stay. Given these maintenance issues, the price felt a bit high.\n\nDespite these concerns, the beds were very comfortable, and the linens were soft and cozy. Aurelie at the front desk was fantastic, and all the staff members were friendly and welcoming.\n\nOverall, with some attention to maintenance, this hotel could easily elevate the experience even further.", "time": 1728319023, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Rebecca Madsen", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103234040938754742742/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVbMdtSxtQqEepO2V0uazDGr7Tq8fsilouRTETTYhp6H2sQyrpkVQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "I'll start with the positives.
