My experience in Paris was severely impacted by the numerous issues I encountered during my stay here.\n\nService Issues:\u2028It seemed that every request we made was either ignored or handled incorrectly. At breakfast, we specifically requested a gluten-free option and were reassured with \u201cno problem.\u201d Yet at the first night what arrived was clearly not gluten-free. On another morning, after placing our breakfast order, we waited 25 minutes only to be told they had forgotten it entirely and we needed to order again. It took over 50 minutes to receive just one omelet, and the side dish sweet vanilla bread that was supposed to come with it never arrived.\n\nRoom Issues:\u2028We made a clear request that both rooms be cleaned by 14:00, as we needed to rest before an important evening concert. Despite this, the rooms were not cleaned by the agreed time. When we returned at 15:00 and placed the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign on the door to rest, housekeeping still called the room insisting they come in to clean, completely disrupting our rest. The beds were small and uncomfortable, making sleep difficult regardless.\nAdditionally, the shower design is poor: even when closed properly, water floods out into the bathroom and even as far as the bedroom floor.\n\nBooking Issues:\u2028We booked four nights, with the first two nights covered by an organization. Despite prior confirmation, we were told at check-in that we had to pay the full amount ourselves. Only after some back and forth was the issue finally resolved.\n\nFor the same high price, you can find far better hotels in central Paris. The lack of professionalism, poor service, and lack of attention to detail significantly diminish the quality of this hotel.
