I was told that the restaurant would allow us to charge phones. I went to the restaurant and paid for two people for breakfast and the staff said we could charge our phones. We really wanted to go explore Paris and eat somewhere else, but our phones were dead since yesterday. Two people for breakfast was nearly $50usd. The electrical power in the plug at the restaurant did t work, but we only knew that after we paid for breakfast. We packed our bags to leave the hotel since we were checking out anyways and I asked the restaurant manager for my money back since the only reason we went there was to charge our phones. The lunatic Asian lady that I assume was the manager started screaming and yelling at me. I went to the front desk to check out and the hotel manager couldn\u2019t be bothered enough to even speak with me. Basically I paid $50 for two dead cell phones and a bowl of yogurt.
