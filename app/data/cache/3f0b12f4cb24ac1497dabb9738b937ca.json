Getting there we were greeted by a load of homeless people asking for money, woke up the next day and as we walked out of the hotel there were a bunch of homeless people sleeping outside which isn't the hotel's fault but they should try to work with the city to clean up the streets so tourists don't feel afraid of walking around the area. Once you make it to the hotel they have a weird policy that you can not leave the hotel with your room key, every time you go out you have to leave your key with reception. The wifi network is slow and blocks access to some sites and connections to outside networks. I work remotely and had to use my cellphone data to connect to my company network and perform my daily duties. The breakfast was cheap and you know what you get for cheap, it was the poorest hotel breakfast I had since we've started our trip, not many options, I had a piece of bread with butter and ham, and a cup of coffee. I can't rate the hotel restaurant as it was closed and when I've asked reception about it they told me the restaurant only opens for Lunch now and drinks up to 7:30 pm. I'm not sure why but it's possible to be because of the amount of homeless people that hangs outside. Overall, the hotel is at a great location and would be a great destination if they can improve their services and work with the city to keep the area more appealing to tourists.", "time": 1751184466, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Patricia Ferrer", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110004285470893657912/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmnBMSW5equYm9GGyyfzNc0b12SuEnKMx8UULxsZUWycFBBxWt=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Great location, perfect for walking, biking, eating and shopping.
