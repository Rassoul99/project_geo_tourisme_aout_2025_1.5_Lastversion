She handed us the key to room 506, and it was such a funny coincidence, as we had stayed in room 507 in Amsterdam. When I mentioned that, she smiled and said, \u201cWell, I hope this one is better!\u201d And it really, really was.\n\nOur room on the 5th floor was bright, cozy, and thoughtfully designed. Beige curtains, warm lighting, carefully chosen textures , it was small but full of personality. I especially appreciated the little design details: a wardrobe area built into the wall with accent wallpaper, mismatched but intentional nightstands (one was metal, the other was a painted wooden stump!), and lovely flooring. It felt curated with love, not just furnished.\n\nThe lobby downstairs was equally impressive \u2014 spacious and stylish, with different seating areas, beautiful couches and armchairs, even a small reading corner with books. There\u2019s also a fridge with drinks at the front desk and a very cozy common area where you can relax or have a coffee.\n\nLocation-wise, it was perfect. Just 10 minutes from Gare du Nord (we arrived on the Eurostar), 25 minutes walking to the Louvre, and we even walked all the way to Montmartre and Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur. There\u2019s a bus stop right outside the hotel (line 32, if I remember correctly), and metro stations close by. We barely used public transport because we could walk everywhere!\n\nThe daily housekeeping was excellent \u2014 clean, tidy, and consistent. There\u2019s also a luggage room, which was super helpful on the day we checked out. Our train wasn\u2019t until the evening, so we left our bags at the hotel, spent a few more hours exploring Paris, then came back, relaxed a bit in the lobby with some coffee, and picked them up before heading to the station.\n\nBut more than anything, what stood out was the hospitality. Every single staff member we interacted with was warm, kind, and welcoming. It felt like the kind of place where people genuinely care about your stay.\n\nIt\u2019s funny , when I compared reviews beforehand, this hotel and our previous one had almost the same star rating. But they\u2019re not even in the same league. This one was miles better. Clean, well-located, cozy, and with a soul. We stayed 5 days and felt completely at home.\n\nHighly recommend. One of the best stays of our entire trip.", "time": 1754161403, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Ines S", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107161511012864752656/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL8zhQkvgf396wQQD0Cjql5n6pAVbW0m6sRZtTvsbHy9g9Nhw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "I recently had the pleasure of staying at 9Hotel Op\u00e9ra for the second time, and I felt it was finally time to share just how wonderful both of my experiences have been. From start to finish, this hotel continues to impress me on every level.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, inviting, and effortlessly stylish, a perfect blend of modern comfort and boutique charm. The rooms are impeccably clean, thoughtfully designed, and the bed is one of the most comfortable I\u2019ve slept in during my travels. Everything feels high quality, from the linens to the little details that make your stay feel special.\n\nEach morning started with a delicious breakfast, fresh, varied, and beautifully presented. It really sets the tone for the day. Whether you\u2019re into pastries, fresh fruit, or something more hearty, there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\nBut what truly sets 9Hotel Op\u00e9ra apart is the exceptional staff. Every team member I interacted with was professional, kind, and genuinely dedicated to making guests feel welcome. A special mention goes to Hanane, the Front Office Manager, and S\u00e9verine, the Director, both of whom embody warmth, hospitality, and attention to detail. Their personal touch made a real difference in my stay, I felt more like a guest in someone\u2019s home than a customer in a hotel.\n\nHaving stayed twice now, I can confidently say that 9Hotel Op\u00e9ra has become my go-to hotel in Paris. Whether you\u2019re visiting for business or leisure, I wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone looking for comfort, service, and a true Parisian boutique experience.
