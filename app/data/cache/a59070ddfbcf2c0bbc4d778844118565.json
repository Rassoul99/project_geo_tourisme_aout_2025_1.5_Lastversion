Our room suggests we had air conditioning, we didn't. The temperature dial on the wall only had an option to be turned down to 5C and there was no air conditioning option. It was 36C outside over the three days we stayed. The cleaners kept leaving the curtains open allowing the heat of the sun to come through.
