We always stay within the area and chose your hotel this time around with great pleasure. We were welcomed immediately by friendly staff.  Since we arrived so early, they did allow us to access our room earlier; however, we had meetings all morning so just had time to drop off the luggage and head out. They kept all our bags safe and secure until our arrival back to the hotel to get into the rooms before our dinner and we were pleasantly guided through the room with a full tour. We needed guidance on how best to get to the airport the next day and what time to leave by, so they organized a nice taxi with ample time to not stress in the morning at 6:30am. Since they noticed breakfast was included and we wouldn't be able to enjoy it since it starts at 7am, they went over and beyond with letting us know they will provide a breakfast to go for us, asking anything we like in advance. This was so kind of them! As the evening approached, we were confused about where to go for dinner as we wanted Thai food, and the kind lady at reception immediately helped us find the best place which we enjoyed so much! Upon our return, we were greeted with a lovely bottle of wine setup in our room, Although we did not have a chance to enjoy it, we were so delighted with this thoughtfulness and wonderful gesture. The next morning as we set out to leave, they provided us with the most beautiful package of breakfast goodies each individually wrapped in the most lovely boxes. Everyone on our flight was so excited to see what was in each of the boxes as we opened with such delight. Honestly, a full 10/10 experience. We did not have anytime to try any of the spas/pools/relaxation places, but we will be back and cannot wait!!! Thank you Thank you Thank you!
