I love this neighborhood as it\u2019s not as touristy, and this specific location had everything you might need by it (restaurants, grocery, pharmacy, boulangerie, etc).\nIt would have been nicer to be a bit closer to the metro, so be prepared to walk 10-15 minutes to get to the train station. Typical for Paris but there are plenty of places that are at least a little bit closer. For the accommodations themselves, the fridge should have been just a bit colder (I was nervous about leaving perishables in there), and having an iron or steamer in the room would have been amazing.
