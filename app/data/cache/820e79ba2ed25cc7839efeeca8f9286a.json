That's about it!\nI will never recommend this hotel.\n\nMy story in 4 acts:\nAct 1: upon my arrival I booked my room through their website but forgot my credit card before I went to Lyon, so I politely asked if it was possible to use my bank details I put on the website. Two people were at the desk the guy was helpful and very kind, the girl (with tainted hair) was extremely rude and didn't want to even listen before sending me away.\nI convinced the nice guy to give me my key room so that I could go on with my work for an hour or 2  before sorting out the money with my bank next to the hotel and he agreed.\n\nAct 2: After 1h and some I heard a lock of my room door and didn't know what it was. It turned out they (a certain manager) disabled the room card because when I left and came back to get my phone I was unable to get in.\nAnyway I sorted it out again with the very helpful man at the desk.\nDone! money sorted out and everything went in order.\n\nAct 3: The following morning I went to have breakfast (very poor I must say) and when I was done and leaving I was accused loudly and publicly by the waitress (?) of stealing a jam container... Yes, a jam container... When I asked what made her say that she showed my earbuds case... Great service !\n\nAct 4: in the afternoon I came back to my room to change, but lucky me, my room card didn't work at the elevator, neither did another couple's card. Thinking the elevator was stuck, o I went to the front desk where only the tainted hair lady was working, I politely waited until she was done with the current client. When I jumped in, waving my card with my eyes asking for help, she very rudely told me : \" can't you see there are other people waiting\". I couldn't hold it and had to tell her that we are blocking the elevator so it's pointless to continue checking in other customers since they will get stuck in line. In a very rude way she took our cards and said that we were allowed to use the elevator for 1 day (when we booked 2 days, yay!).\n\nExcept for the helpful guy at the front desk, nothing was ok in that hotel.
