Also, as a solo woman traveler, I needed a location with staff on site 24/7. I also checked multiple review sites, mapped the location, and viewed photos. I checked to make sure all reviews were within 6 months, versus 6 years ago. (I noticed that many hotels in Italy have no recent reviews.) This hotel met my vital needs.\n\nThe extras were the friendly faces that greeted me at the desk upon arrival, the happy hour barista in the hotel that serves complimentary cocktails, Italian wine, cappuccinos and espressos. English is understood and spoken, which if this is your first time to Italy, like it was for me, it was helpful. There is an elevator, which is nice to have in Italy. The other hotel guests I met were all friendly to me also. The hotel is peaceful and quiet. I was there in July, which is the most insanely busy time to travel to Italy. So having a quiet, gentle hotel which you can return to after a busy, intense day in Milan is a MUST for a traveler like me.\n\nThe hotel is a step above basic, and its very clean, neat and attended to. You can tell the hotel is loved. I would say from my experience with hotels, it's a 2.5 to 3-star hotel in Milan. The helpful and friendly staff will call a taxi for you, provide umbrellas, and share their recommendations on restaurants and directions, and will make reservations for you, as needed. I noticed mostly couples there, slightly older which I prefer as a solo woman traveler.\n\nRoom\nMy room was a single and faced the interior garden, which was lovely. The single room is small and tight. The windows fully open, and have wood blinds if you'd like to keep the fresh outside air coming through the room. I loved mine because the night I stayed there, there was a beautiful Italian thunderstorm that I loved listening to in my room.\n\nBathroom\nThe bathroom was clean and tiny--typical of Europe. Fresh towels, soap and shampoo is provided. Availability of shampoo, conditioner and lotion is not always a guarantee in European hotels, shower gel (which I don't prefer) seems to be the norm, so always check first. I always bring my own body lotion and hair products, I have very dry skin and natural hair.\n\nI recommend Hotel Gran Duca di York without reservations.
