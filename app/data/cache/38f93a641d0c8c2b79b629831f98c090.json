We did ask for a further pillow, which was provided on the second night. The kitchenette was nice enough, but we made use of the location and ate out every day. Nothing really special or bad about the room as a whole, other than the bed, and for some reason, no coffee or tea was provided, however, if you want to there is a spar opposite from which you can purchase everything. Everything was clean so that's a plus.\n\nLocation: The location was good, about 20-30 minutes to the Capitole square, but there's plenty of shops, cafe's etc in between, so the walk isn't much of an issue.\n\nIn summary, I would consider this a 3* accommodation, at best, possibly 2* to the more picky traveller. Toulouse is a beautiful city, with equally lovely people, scratch up on your French, you'll certainly need it!

There is a new Low Emission Zone in Toulouse with a complex sticker system which our hire car didn't have. The apartment is in the zone. Apparently camera enforcement may be introduced in 2024 but in 2023 we were advised that because we were parking underground there was no chance the restriction would be enforced so we had to just hope.
