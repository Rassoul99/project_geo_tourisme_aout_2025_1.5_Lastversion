We arrived as a party of two for dinner, curious to see if it would live up to its reputation.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the French onion soup and a roasted beet salad with two types of beets. Initially, the soup looked promising \u2013 it was served in a large bowl and had a creamy appearance. However, we quickly discovered that the bowl was mostly filled with caramelized onions and barely any broth. As a result, the dish ended up being overly sweet and unbalanced, almost to the point of being difficult to eat. Essentially, it didn't resemble a soup at all.\n\nThe roasted beet salad, on the other hand, was enjoyable. The combination of flavors was interesting, mainly thanks to the cheeses that accompanied the dish. The presentation was also appealing. While the salad was pleasant, it didn't stand out with particularly unique flavors.\n\nFor the main courses, we chose the traditional veal stew and a sea bass fillet. Both dishes were well-prepared and flavorful, and we genuinely enjoyed them. To accompany our meal, we ordered a chilled white wine, which turned out to be a great choice and reasonably priced.\n\nOverall, the experience was somewhat mixed. While the main courses and wine were satisfying, the disappointing onion soup left us feeling that the meal didn\u2019t fully meet our expectations.", "time": 1744057565, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "D-Rick john", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116554830690617870426/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJvc4Xr0_BXPsa3rmahjXbxqqBsWgz7_VZx1pNOFsfv4gMvKg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "One of the worst dining experiences we had during our two weeks in Paris. \"Au Petit Riche\" We waited at the front to be checked in while other groups walked straight past us. Booking felt pointless \u2014 would\u2019ve been quicker to just walk in. The bartender was arrogant and moody. The restaurant is huge but clearly understaffed. Our waiter, Anthony, seated us at table 54.\n\nWe were crammed into a small space with rickety chairs and too many tables. The vibe was unfriendly, almost like you\u2019re supposed to feel lucky just to be there. Staff didn\u2019t seem welcoming \u2014 maybe they just don\u2019t like foreigners? Other guests were eating while still wearing their coats like they were dressed to walk their dog.\n\nThe only bright spot was the tall manager, who seemed professional and friendly and upbeat, but he was busy with a black-tie event upstairs so I didn't get to raise my points of disappointment with him.\n\nI ordered a fillet steak for my son, medium-rare, I specifically said, \u201cPlease please don\u2019t serve it too rare.\u201d It came out nearly blue, see the photo, it didn't get eaten. The pate en croute was nice.\n\nI complained. The waiter apologised but didn\u2019t even take it off the bill, despite knowing we didn\u2019t eat it. He offered something else, but at that point, we just wanted to leave. I felt he was too nervous or too new to deal with it properly or speak to the chef or manager they should train the staff how to deal with problems. Not acceptable.\n\nWe left and took our son to eat somewhere else. Total disappointment. This place feels old, tired, and arrogant, living off a once-good reputation. Definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend. Give it a miss.\n\nI think that the place has too many customers who are scared to stick up for themselves or mention disappointments.", "time": 1745481912, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Gabriele Gori", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110791538647791077946/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK7Tj99WnLWA6-TwWBWo1DFhscNQNr8-5eZiAECHJTJliRIRg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "A dive into the past, from the d\u00e9cor to the waiters\u2019 uniforms.
